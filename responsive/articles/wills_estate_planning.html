<p>Wills and Estate Planning</p>
<p>SAVE MONEY AND PROVIDE FOR YOUR LOVED ONES</p>
<p>As average Americans, we work 80,000 hours in a lifetime, or 45 to 55 years.   In spite of all the resources and assets we earn, the vast majority of us do not   take the time to create a will.</p>
<p>National statistics indicate that 80% of Americans die without leaving a   will. There are several reasons for this: fear of death; procrastination; and   misinformation (people presume that only the rich need to have wills). Whatever   the excuse, it is clear that people would benefit from having a will.</p>
<p>In the absence of a will or other legal arrangement to distribute property at   death, the state must step in to administer the estate. The result can be   lengthy delays before the rightful heirs receive their property. And because the   state has no instructions from the deceased, no charitable gifts will be   made.</p>
<p>IF YOU HAVE NO WILL:</p>
<p>If you leave no Will or your Will is declared invalid because it was   improperly prepared or is not admissible to probate:</p>
<p>* State law determines who gets assets, not you * Additional expenses will be   incurred and extra work will be required to qualify an administrator * Judge   determines who gets custody of your children * Possible additional State   inheritance taxes and Federal estate taxes * If you have no spouse or close   relatives the State may take your property * The procedure to distribute assets   becomes more complicated-and the law makes no exceptions for persons in unusual   need or for your own wishes. * It may also cause fights and lawsuits within your   family When loved ones are grieving and dealing with death, they shouldn&rsquo;t be   overwhelmed with Financial concerns. Careful estate planning helps take care of   that.</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING IS A SAMPLE OF A VARIETY OF CLAUSES AND ITEMS WHICH SHOULD BE   INCLUDED IN A WILL:</p>
<p>1ST: DEBTS AND TAXES 2ND: SPECIFIC BEQUESTS 3RD: DISPOSITION TO SPOUSE 4TH:   DISPOSITION OF REMAINDER OF ESTATE 5TH: CREATION OF TRUSTS FOR SPOUSE 6TH:   CREATION OF TRUST FOR CHILDREN 7TH: OTHER BENEFICIARIES UNDER 21 8TH: EXECUTORS   9TH: TRUSTEES 10TH: GUARDIANS 11TH: SURETY OR BOND 12TH: POWERS 13TH: AFTERBORN   CHILDREN 14TH: PRINCIPAL AND INCOME 15TH: NO ASSIGNMENT OF BEQUESTS 16TH: GENDER   17TH: CONSTRUCTION OF WILL 18TH: NO CONTEST CLAUSE</p>
<p>A will must not only be prepared within the legal requirements of the New   Jersey Statutes but should also be prepared so it leaves no questions regarding   your intentions.</p>
<p>WHY PERIODIC REVIEW IS ESSENTIAL</p>
<p>Even if you have an existing Will, there are many events that occur which may   necessitate changes in your Will. Some of these are:</p>
<p>* Marriage, death, birth, divorce or separation affecting either you or   anyone named in your Will</p>
<p>*Significant changes in the value of your total assets or in any particular   assets which you own</p>
<p>* A change in your domicile</p>
<p>* Death or incapacity of a beneficiary, or death, incapacity or change in   residence of a named executor, trustee or guardian of infants, or of one of the   witnesses to the execution of the Will</p>
<p>*Annual changes in tax law</p>
<p>MAY I CHANGE MY WILL?</p>
<p>Yes. A Will may be modified, added to, or entirely changed at any time before   your death provided you are mentally and physically competent and desire to   change your Will. You should consider revising your Will whenever there are   changes in the size of your estate. For example, when your children are young,   you may think it best to have a trust for them so they do not come into absolute   ownership of property until they are mature. Beware, if you draw lines through   items, erase or write over, or add notations to the original Will, it can be   destroyed as a legal document. Either a new Will should be legally prepared or a   codicil signed to legally change portions of the Will.</p>
<p>SAVE MONEY</p>
<p>Your estate will be subject to probate whether or not you have a Will and in   most cases, a Will reduces the cost by eliminating the requirements of a bond.   With a well-drawn Will, you may also reduce death taxes and other expenses.   Don't pinch pennies now to the detriment of your beneficiaries. We have   attempted to briefly explain in this article some of the issues, techniques, and   decisions involved in Wills, Estate Planning, and Administration of an Estate.   Because the matters covered are complicated and the Federal and New Jersey laws   frequently change, this article can only outline some of the many legal issues   you should consider.</p>
<p>The proper preparation of a Will should involve a careful analysis of the   client's assets, family and his/her desires. Estate Planning is the process of   examining what will happen to your property when you die and arranging for its   distribution in such a manner as will accomplish your objectives. The cost of a   Will depends on the size and the complexity of the estate and the plans of the   person who makes the Will.</p>
<p>A properly drawn Simple Will without Trust costs approximately $100.00 to   $500.00. It is one of the most important documents you will ever sign, and may   be one of the best bargains you will ever have. Be sure your Will takes into   account the 1997 Federal Tax changes and all New Jersey Inheritance Tax changes.   Also, ascertain if your Will is &ldquo;self-proving&rdquo;, which would dispense with having   to find the Will√≠s witnesses after death.</p>
<p>WHAT IS A WILL?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Will is a Legal written document which, after your death, directs how your   individually owned property will be distributed, who will be in charge of your   property until it is distributed and who will take care of your minor children   if the other parent should die . You should remember that the term &ldquo;property&rdquo;   under the law includes real estate as well as other possessions and rights to   receive money or items of value.&rdquo; Everyone who has at least $3,000 in assets   should have a Will. You do not have to be wealthy, married, or near death to do   some serious thinking about your Will.</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATION OF AN ESTATE</p>
<p>If you are named the executor or executrix, you must visit the County   Surrogate to probate the Will. You will need the following items: 1. The Death   Certificate 2. The Original Will 3. Names and Addresses of decedent's, next of   kin and will beneficiaries 4. Minimum of $80.00 for Surrogate fees</p>
<p>A state inheritance tax return must be filed and the tax paid on the transfer   of real or personal property within eight months after death.</p>
