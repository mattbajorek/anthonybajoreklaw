<p>AT THE END OF THE TRIAL, THE JUDGE WILL READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS AND   LAW TO THE JURY:</p>
<p>RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY</p>
<p>(N.J.S.A. 2C:20-7(a))</p>
<p>The defendant is charged with the crime of receiving stolen property.   [Describe the property allegedly involved] This charge is based on a statute   which reads:</p>
<p>A person is guilty of theft if he knowingly receives (or brings into this   State) movable property of another knowing that it has been stolen, or believing   that it has probably been stolen.1</p>
<p>Under this statute the State must prove 3 elements to establish that a   defendant is guilty of receiving stolen property. These elements are: 1. That   the defendant received (or brought into this State) movable property of another;   2. That the defendant acted knowingly when he/she received (or brought into this   State) the movable property of another; 3. That the defendant either knew that   the property had been stolen or believed that it had probably been stolen2 at   the time he/she received the property (or brought the property into this   State).</p>
<p>The first element that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that   the defendant received (or brought into this State) movable property of another.   The term receive means toacquire possession, control, or title (or to lend on   the security) of the property.3</p>
<p>(Charge Model Charge on Possession, N.J.S.A. 2C:2-1c)</p>
<p>The term movable property means property, the location of which can be   changed (including things growing on, affixed to, or found in land, and   documents, although the rights represented thereby have no physical location).4   The term property means anything of value.5 Property of another means property   in which the defendant does not have a lawful interest.6 The State need not,   however, prove the identity of the owner, the identity of the original thief,7   or the identity of the person from whom the defendant received the property. The   second element that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the   defendant acted knowingly when (he/she) received (or brought into this State)   the movable property of another.</p>
<p>A person acts knowingly with respect to the nature of (his/her) conduct or   the attendantcircumstances if (he/she) is aware that (his/her) conduct is of   that nature, or that such circumstances exist, or (he/she) is aware of a high   probability of their existence. A person acts knowingly with respect to a result   of (his/her) conduct if (he/she) is aware that it is practically certain that   (his/her) conduct will cause such a result. Knowing, with knowledge or   equivalent terms have the same meaning.8</p>
<p>The third element that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that   the defendant either knew that the property had been stolen or believed that it   had probably been stolen at the time the defendant received the property (or   brought the property into this State). Stolen property means property that has   been the subject of any unlawful taking. An unlawful taking occurs when a person   takes or exercises unlawful control over the property of another with the   purpose, that is, the conscious object, of depriving the other of it permanently   or for so extended a period as to appropriate a substantial portion of its   economic value.9 I have already defined the term knowing to you in discussing   the second element and I will not repeat it here. The State is not required to   prove that the property, in fact, had been stolen. On the other hand, mere proof   that the property was stolen is not sufficient to establish this element.   Rather, what the State must prove is that the defendant either knew that the   property was stolen or believed that it had probably been stolen. A belief that   property has probably been stolen is a belief that it is more likely than not   that the property had been stolen. You must realize that knowledge and belief   are states of mind which cannot be seen but can only be determined by drawing   inferences from ones conduct, words or actions, and from all of the surrounding   circumstances. It therefore is not necessary that the State produce witnesses to   testify that the defendant said (he/she) knew or believed the property was   stolen. (His/her) state of mind is to be determined by you after you examine   (his/her) conduct and actions, all that was said or doneat that particular time   and place, and all the surrounding circumstances.10</p>
<p>To reiterate, the three elements which the State must prove are: 1. That the   defendant received (or brought into this State) movable property of another; 2.   That in so doing the defendant acted knowingly; and 3. That the defendant either   knew that the property had been stolen or believed that it had probably been   stolen when (he/she) received it (or brought it into this State).11</p>
<p>If you conclude the State has proven all three elements of this offense   beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find the defendant guilty. On the other   hand, if you find that the State has failed to prove any element beyond a   reasonable doubt, you must find the defendant not guilty.</p>
<p>(NOTE: Do not charge the following for certain types of property such as an   automobile or</p>
<p>firearm. See N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2b(2)(b) and (c).)</p>
<p>Since the value of the property involved determines the degree or severity of   the crime, the State must also prove its value beyond a reasonable doubt. If you   find the defendant guilty, then youmust indicate whether you find the value of   the property involved:</p>
<p>(1) exceeds $500, (2) is at least $200 but does not exceed $500, or (3) is   less than $200.</p>
<p>Value is to be determined by the fair market value of the property at the   time the defendant is alleged to have received or brought into this State the   movable property of another. Fair market value means the price that a buyer   would be willing to pay and a seller would be willing to accept if both parties   were aware of all the relevant surrounding circumstances and neither party were   under any compulsion to buy or sell.</p>
<p>1 The language or brings into this State is placed in parentheses to suggest   that in a case where there is nothing to indicate that this language applies,   consideration might be given to deleting the language and thereby eliminating   unnecessary verbiage.</p>
<p>2 Where the defendant is also the person who took the property, the third   element must be modified. State v. Underwood, 286 N.J. Super. 129 (App. Div.   1995). In such cases, the State must prove that the defendant intended an   unlawful taking, id. at 135; that is, the defendant acted with the purpose to   permanently deprive the owner of the property. Id. at 138. Thus, in such cases   the third element could be phrased as follows: The property was stolen by the   defendant. In order for you to find that the defendant stole the property, the   State must prove that the defendant acted with the purpose to deprive the owner   of the property. To deprive means to withhold or cause to be withheld property   of another permanently or for so extended a period as to appropriate a   substantial portion of its economic value... (N.J.S.A. 2C:20-1a) A person acts   purposely with respect to the nature of his conduct or a result thereof if it is   his or her conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or cause such a   result. (N.J.S.A. 2C:2-2b(1)).</p>
<p>3 N.J.S.A. 2C:20-7a. It is suggested that the language or to lend on the   security only be charged when it applies to the facts of the case.</p>
<p>4 N.J.S.A. 2C:20-1e. It is suggested that the language relating to things on   land or documents be charged only when it applies to the facts of the case.</p>
<p>5 N.J.S.A. 2C:20-1g. The statutory definition gives examples of various types   of property as being included in the definition, such as trade secrets and   choses in action. Reference should be made to the statutory definition in   particular cases to determine whether additional language should be charged.</p>
<p>6 N.J.S.A. 2C:20-1h. This is not the complete definition of property of   another, but should be sufficient in the usual case. The definition goes on to   address joint ownership issues, contraband, and security interests. When   applicable under the facts of a case, this language should be included.</p>
<p>7 Consideration should be given to deleting the language as to the identity   of the thief in an Underwood situation. See fn. 2, supra.</p>
<p>8 N.J.S.A. 2C:2-2b(2).</p>
<p>9 N.J.S.A. 2C:20-1a and p; State v. Underwood, supra, 286 N.J. Super. at   135-136.</p>
<p>10 In the appropriate case, the jury may be advised that such knowledge or   belief may be inferred from the presence of the factors set forth in N.J.S.A.   2C:20-7b if the evidence provides a factual basis for such an instruction. See   State v. Humphrey, 183 N.J. Super. 580 (Law Div. 1982); N.J.R.E. 303; N.J.S.A.   2C:1-13e.</p>
<p>If the jury is instructed as to an inference permitted by N.J.S.A. 2C:20-7b,   care should be taken to avoid the use of the term presumption and it should be   clearly stated that the inference is only permissive in nature. Thus, language   such as the following should be charged:</p>
<p>However, you are never required or compelled to draw this inference. It is   your exclusive province to determine whether the facts and circumstances shown   by the evidence support any inference and you are always free to accept them or   reject them if you wish.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that aside from the inference authorized by the   statute, there is a question as to whether recent unexplained possession of   stolen property permits an inference of guilty knowledge. The former receiving   stolen property statute (N.J.S.A. 2A:139-1) provided for such an inference (see   State v. DiRienzo, 53 N.J. 360 (1969) and one trial level court has held that a   common law inference still may be drawn even in the absence of a specific   statutory authorization. State in the Interest of L.L.A., 178 N.J. Super. 555   (J. &amp; D.R. Ct. 1980); cf. State v. Burch, 179 N.J. Super. 336 (App. Div.   1981) certif. den. 89 N.J. 396 (1981) (applying inference in theft by unlawful   taking prosecution under N.J.S.A. 2C:20-3.); see also State v. Ippolito, 287   N.J. Super. 375, 383 (App. Div. 1996) (holding in theft by unlawful taking case   that {t}he inference charge is given when there is a dispute concerning the   identity of the person who physically took the property, but is inappropriate   where . . . defendant admits that he took the property and possessed it from the   time it was taken until it was recovered but he has explained his possession as   a claim of right.)</p>
<p>In contrast, one commentator has suggested that the common law inference does   not appear to have survived the enactment of the Code, at least with respect to   receiving, as opposed to unlawful taking, prosecutions. Cannel, Title 2C:   CRIMINAL CODE ANNOTATED, COMMENT TO N.J.S.A. 2C:20-7 at p. 437.</p>
<p>If the inference of guilty knowledge from recent, unexplained possession of   stolen property is to be charged, care should be taken not to charge it in such   a manner or under such circumstances as to violate a non-testifying defendants   right to remain silent. This issue is discussed in State v. Burch, supra, 179   N.J. Super. 336. There, the court stated that when it isclear from the record   that defendant is the only source to supply (an) explanation, the instruction is   prejudicial and should not be given. Id. However, the court also noted that in a   stolen property case some evidence, other than the defendants testimony, such as   a sales slip or sales clerk, is usually available to the defense to account for   innocent possession. Id. at 343. Thus, the court concluded that the instruction   concerning the inference was proper even though there (was) an absence of a   specific showing in the record as to the availability of an evidence source   other than the defendants own testimony . . . Id. at 343-44; see also State v.   DiRienzo, 53 N.J. 360 (1969) and State v. Dent, 51 N.J. 428 (1968) which are   discussed in Burch.</p>
<p>11 If the evidence requires, any affirmative defenses should be charged at   this point. See e.g. N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2c. With respect to a claim of right defense   pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:20-2c(2), see State v. Ippolito, supra, 287 N.J. Super.   375 and separate model jury charge.</p>
<p>NOTE ALSO that N.J.S.A. 2C:20-7a specifically says that it is an affirmative   defense that the property was received with the purpose to restore it to the   owner. This defense must be charged when there is a basis for it in the   evidence. State v. Underwood, supra, 286 N.J. Super. at 138.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences of a Criminal Guilty Plea</strong></p>
<p>1. You will have to appear in open court and tell the judge what you did that   makes you guilty of the particular offense(s)</p>
