  When the Workers Compensation Act was passed many years ago it was   probably the first true &quot;no fault&quot; law in this State. With some very narrow   exceptions, the question of negligence (fault) is not an issue if a worker is   hurt on the job. Whether or not the employer is at fault has no impact on the   worth of a case. In cases involving injuries suffered in connection with   employment, your lawyer will represent you without payment in advance.</p>
<p>If a worker is injured on the job, the worker has three basic rights:</p>
<p>(1) the right to medical treatment;</p>
<p>(2) the right to receive payment (temporary disability) for lost time;   and</p>
<p>(3) the right to receive payment for any after-effects of the injury if the   after-effects are found to be permanent (partial permanent disability).</p>
<p>If you are injured, you should immediately report the accident. Make sure an   accident report is filled out and write down the names of all witnesses.</p>
<p><br />
  When a worker is injured on the job, the employer or the employers   insurance company are obligated to furnish and pay for medical treatment.   However, in New Jersey, the employer has the right to select the doctors who   will provide that treatment, since its the employer or its insurance company who   is responsible for payment of medical expenses. It follows that if the worker   does not go to the authorized treating doctor, then the employer will generally   not be responsible for<br />
  payment of the medical expenses. When an employee is   hurt on the job, the employee is entitled to receive temporary disability   benefits of 70% of wages up to an amount set by the State. For example, the   maximum amount for an injury in 1997 is $496 per week. These benefits   are<br />
  payable on a retroactive basis if the employee is out at least seven (7)   days and the treating doctor certifies that the employee cannot work.</p>
<p><br />
  In general, temporary disability benefits will continue to be paid so   long as the workers treating doctor certifies that the employee cannot work.</p>
<p><br />
  When medical treatment is completed and the employee is able to return to   work, there may be a basis for payment to the employee of benefits for the   after-effects of the injury. This is called partial permanent disability and is   based on a schedule which utilizes a system of assigning value to each part of   the body on a scale of 1% to 100%.</p>
<p>Generally, the issue of partial permanent disability is resolved by filing a   claim in the Division of Workers Compensation. A lawyer who represents a   claimant before the Division of Workers Compensation may not charge any fee in   advance. An Administrative Law Judge who hears<br />
  the case will set the fee   (never more than 20%) and if there is no recovery, an attorney will not be   allowed a fee.</p>
<p>Finally, disposition of a claim in the Division of Workers Compensation will   not always operate to end a claim. There are rights and obligations on the part   of both the employer and the employee.<br />
  Since an employee is not obligated to   pay a fee in a workers compensation case unless awarded by the Court, it would   make sense for the employee to immediately consult an attorney to protect   his/her rights.</p>
<p><br />
  The employee should also be aware of the fact that there are time limits   regarding the reporting of accidents. The safest approach is, of course, to   report a work related accident immediately, even if it seems relatively minor at   the time. Failure to report an accident can cause delays in receiving temporary   disability and other benefits.</p>
<p>When you meet with a workers compensation attorney, the following information   will be requested from you:</p>
<p>1. Name, address and telephone number.</p>
<p>2. Name, address and telephone number of employer.</p>
<p>3. Name, address and telephone number of any union the client is a member of   , along with full details of any union benefits that may have been received or   to which the client has a right. (There may be a union benefit plan which   provides the employee with payments for drugs and medical bills in addition to   workers compensation benefits.)</p>
<p>4. The job title the client held when injured, along with the clients   educational background and previous employment history.</p>
<p>5. The nature of the employers business.</p>
<p>6. Your Social Security number.</p>
<p>7. Your sex, age, and marital status at the time of the accident.</p>
<p>8. The name of the employers workers compensation insurance carrier or   indication of whether the employer is self-insured.</p>
<p>9. The exact details of how you gave notice of the accident to the employer   or whether the facts and circumstances are such that the employer must have had   knowledge.</p>
<p>10. The exact place where the accident occurred and the date and time of the   occurrence.</p>
<p>11. A full description in your own handwriting of how the accident occurred   or to the exposures if an occupational disease case.</p>
<p>12. Your wages or earnings and whether on time or piece-work basis, the rate   per hour, or the weekly wage.</p>
<p>13. The date when you stopped work and the date of return to work.</p>
<p>14. A statement of past and present complaints, as well as a description of   all body parts affected by the accident. Explain any emotional complaints since   the accident to investigate the question of neuro-psychiatric disability.</p>
<p>15. The compensation paid for temporary or permanent disability must be   ascertained.</p>
<p>16. Full details as to medical aid required and whether it was requested from   the employer. If the medical treatment was furnished by the employer, all dates   of treatment should be inventoried. If the employer refused to furnish the   treatment, indicate in detail all requests made to the employer for treatment,   as well as obtaining the names and addresses of all doctors who furnished the   treatment.</p>
<p>17. Be certain you have the names and addresses of all physicians and   hospitals who rendered medical treatment since the accident, including but not   limited to the injuries arising from the accident. Attempt to obtain the amount   of all physicians bills and prepare a file for paid<br />
  and unpaid bills.</p>
<p>If you are receiving medical treatment from a doctor of your choice or if the   employer has refused to render medical treatment, the attorney must give written   notification to the employer and its<br />
  insurance carrier of all the details   concerning your injuries and accident and the name and address of the doctor by   whom he is being treated or the name and address of the doctor who is going to   be treating him. The attorney must clearly indicate in the letter that this is a   formal request pursuant to Title 34 for the employer/respondent to furnish   medical treatment by the doctor chosen by the petitioner or, alternatively, that   the respondent should immediately provide the name and address of a doctor that   it wants to treat the petitioner. In Workers Compensation, the respondent   controls the choice of doctor.</p>
<p>18. Any Blue Cross, Blue Shield, or major medical plans which cover you, as   well as identification numbers, since it may be possible to obtain payment for   medical bills from these plans, if the<br />
  employer/workers compensation refuses   to make payment. See Workers Compensation (ICLE 1983).</p>
<p>If you are injured while working, we recommend you immediately speak with an   experienced attorney.</p>
