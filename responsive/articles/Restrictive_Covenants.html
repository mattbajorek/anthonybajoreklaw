<p>Non-compete Covenants in employee agreements - Don't Let Your Employees steal   your Clients</p>
<p>Most businesses spend thousands of dollars   developing client lists, training staff and promoting and advertising their   businesses. After investing substantial time and money in good will, an owner   needs to protect the business from employees attempting to leave and take away   accounts. Without a non-compete clause and a restrictive covenant, an employee   can open up a competing business on the same street! An employer does not want   to pay an employee to build relationships and develop a business, only for that   employee to leave, take the fruits of the employers investment, and compete   directly against the employer. The NJ Supreme Court granted greater protection   to employers and businesses in Lamorte Burns &amp; Co., Inc. v. Walters 167 N.J.   285 (2001)</p>
<p>The Court in Lamorte held: By secretly collecting confidential and   proprietary client information while employed by Lamorte Burns &amp; Co., Inc.   and using the data to solicit and take away Lamortes clients immediately after   resigning, Michael Walters and Nancy Nixon breached their duty of loyalty,   tortiously interfered with Lamortes economic advantage, misappropriated   confidential and proprietary information, and competed unfairly.</p>
<p>The Court in Lamorte determined that: The client information gathered from   Lamortes files by Walters and Nixon was not generally available to the public,   would not have been known to defendants but for their employment by Lamorte,   went beyond mere client names, and gave defendants an advantage in soliciting   clients after they resigned. Walters and Nixon knew Lamorte had an interest in   protecting the information. The client information was confidential and   proprietary.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in Lamorte also determined that: An employee may prepare to   start a competing business while employed by the entity he will compete with,   but may not breach the undivided duty of loyalty owed the employer while still   employed by soliciting the employers customers or engaging in other acts of   secret competition. Walters and Nixon breached the duty of loyalty by collecting   protected information while employed by Lamorte for the sole purpose of gaining   an advantage over Lamorte as soon as they resigned.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in Lamorte held that: Walters and Nixon acted with malice   and in a manner contrary to the notion of free and fair competition by using the   secretly gathered confidential client data to effect a weekend coup, knowing   that the delay in Lamortes discovery of their resignation and solicitation would   work to their economic advantage Restrictive covenants are very useful for   businesses to prevent an employee from taking your clients and your   business.</p>
<p>Recently, the NJ Supreme Court ruled an non-compete covenant as enforceable   and not against public policy. In Maw v. Advanced Clinical Communications, Inc   (ACCI) 179 N.J. 439, 846 A.2d 1222. (2004). In this case, Karol Maw began   working for Advanced Clinical Communications, Inc. (ACCI) as a graphic designer   on November 1, 1997. ACCI provides marketing and educational services for the   pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. Maw had been hired to design written   materials used by ACCI in its marketing and educational programs. Maw was   promoted to Senior Graphic Designer in January 2001. Thereafter, pursuant to a   new company policy, ACCI required all of its employees at or above the level of   ³coordinator² to sign a non-compete agreement as a condition of continuing   employment. The agreement precluded, among other things, Maw from becoming   employed by any competitor or customer of ACCI for a period of two years   following the termination of her employment. Maw was informed that she could   seek legal advice concerning the employment agreement. Maw consulted her father,   an attorney, who suggested changes. Maw presented those revisions to ACCI¹s   Human Resource Department but was told that no changes could be made. Maw did   not sign the non-compete agreement, prompting her termination by ACCI in March   2001 for failing to comply with company policy. The court in Maw held her   conscientious employee CEPA claim must fail because our State¹s public policy   respecting noncompete agreements is not set forth in a ³clear mandate,² and does   not ³concern[] the public health, safety or welfare or protection of the   environment.² N.J.S.A. 34:19-3c(3). Over a generation ago, our Court sketched   the broad parameters for determining whether a noncompete agreement was   unenforceable. Whitmyer Bros., Inc. v. Doyle, 58 N.J. 25 (1971); Solari Indus.   Inc. v. Malady, 55 N.J. 571 (1970). In Solari, the Supreme Court canvassed, the   historical treatment of noncompete agreements, and acknowledged the previously   held negative view of such agreements. 55 N.J. at 575-84. The Court cited   academic writings on the topic that elaborated in greater detail on the relation   of such agreements to Anglo-American commercial practices. See, e.g., Solari,   supra, 55 N.J. at 574-77 (citing Harlan M. Blake, Employee Agreements Not to   Compete, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 625 (1960)). The court in Maw further held: But Solari   was a turning point, for the Court held then ³that the time is well due for the   abandonment of New Jersey¹s void per se rule in favor of the rule which permits   the total or partial enforcement of noncompetitive agreements to the extent   reasonable under the circumstances.² 55 N.J. at 585. In Whitmyer, supra, The   Court expanded on Solari, establishing what is now known as the Solari/Whitmyer   test for determining whether a noncompete agreement is unreasonable and   therefore unenforceable. Under the Solari/Whitmyer test, a noncompete agreement   is enforceable ³if it Osimply protects the legitimate interests of the employer,   imposes no undue hardship on the employee and is not injurious to the public.¹²   Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Ciavatta, 110 N.J. 609, 628 (1988) (quoting Whitmyer,   supra, 58 N.J. at 32-33). The first two prongs of the test require a balancing   of the employer¹s interests in protecting proprietary and confidential   information and the asserted hardship on the employee. Ingersoll-Rand, supra,   110 N.J. at 634-35. The third requires the reviewing court to analyze the   public¹s broad concern in fostering competition, creativity, and ingenuity. Id.   at 639. Solari/Whitmyer has now become an accepted part of the common law, not   only in New Jersey but also in other jurisdictions around the country. Id. at   630-34. The court in Maw further held: Although our dissenting colleagues may   contend that do-not-compete provisions are, or should be, per se illegal, in   point of fact, they are not illegal per se. It is not accurate to describe our   current caselaw, which allows enforcement of reasonable non-compete agreements,   as a ³clear mandate² that disfavors such agreements. The Solari/Whitmyer test is   a multi-part, fact-intensive inquiry. Not only must multiple interests of   differing parties and entities be identified, but also, those interests must be   gauged for reasonableness and legitimacy. The application of that test here, and   as a general matter, simply does not evoke the type of a ³clear mandate of   public policy² that was contemplated by N.J.S.A. 34:19-3c(3). The court in Maw   further held: The Court are informed by the amici that non-compete agreements   are a common part of commercial employment. The Court do not accept as a premise   that employers, in large numbers, are engaging in a practice that is   ³indisputably dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare.² Dzwonar,   supra, 177 N.J. at 464. It is more appropriate to characterize the business   community as having adapted to the Solari/Whitmyer approach that recognizes that   noncompete agreements can serve a useful purpose so long as the agreement is not   unreasonable. The court in Maw concluded that plaintiff¹s private dispute over   the terms of the do-not-compete provision in her employment agreement does not   implicate violation of a clear mandate of public policy as contemplated by   Section 3c(3) of CEPA. As previously noted, plaintiff did have options available   to her. If she could not negotiate terms that were to her liking, she was free   to dispute the reasonableness of those terms if and when her employer attempted   to enforce the agreement. The burden then would be on the employer to hire   counsel and initiate enforcement litigation, Solari, supra, 55 N.J. at 574, and   nothing would preclude an employee-defendant in such an action from asserting   any and all affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Ingersoll- Rand, supra, 110   N.J. at 621-22</p>
