<p align="center">
<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC represents individuals charged with criminal and serious traffic violations   throughout New Jersey.</p>
<p>Theft of Movable property 2C:20-2</p>
<p>If someone is criminally indicted for theft, at trial the judge will read to   the jurors the following jury instructions of the law:</p>
<p>The following charge is to be used when the factual circumstances indicate an   unlawful taking of personal property and the value of the property is in   dispute. In other instances, reference must be made to 2C:20-2b to determine the   degree of theft. See Charge # 2.291 on GRADATION OF THEFT OFFENSES. Note that   2C:20-2b(2) makes some offenses of the third degree regardless of the value of   the property).</p>
<p>The indictment charges the defendant with (here read the indictment) . The   statute on which the indictment is based is 2C:20-3a which reads in its   pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p>A person is guilty of theft if he unlawfully takes, or exercises control over   movable property of another with purpose to deprive him thereof.</p>
<p>(If appropriate, here define &quot;movable property, &quot;property&quot; and &quot;property of   another.&quot;)</p>
<p>You cannot find the defendant guilty unless you determine that the State has   proven the following two elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>
<p>First, the State must prove that the defendant unlawfully took (here describe   property listed in indictment). In order to prove an unlawful taking, the State   need not prove that the property was carried out of the place in which it was   kept, but only that it was moved or taken from its original location. If the   defendant is found with the stolen property shortly after it was taken, charge   the jury that it may draw an inference that the defendant took the   property).</p>
<p>Second, the State must prove that at the time the defendant took this   property (his/her) purpose was to deprive the owner of the (here describe   property). With regard to the requirement of proof of a purpose to deprive   another of (his/her) property, you are instructed that a person acts purposely   with respect to the nature of (his/her) conduct or a result thereof if it is   (his/her) conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such   a result. In other words, in order for you to find that the defendant acted   purposely, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time the   defendant took the property it was (his/her) conscious object to deprive (the   owner) of (describe property).</p>
<p>(If appropriate, insert relevant portions of the following definition.)   &quot;Deprive&quot; means</p>
<p>(1) to withhold (or cause to be withheld) property of another permanently or   for so extended a period as to appropriate a substantial portion of its economic   value...or,</p>
<p>(2) to dispose (or cause disposal) of the property so as to make it unlikely   that the owner will recover it).</p>
<p>Thus, if you find after a careful consideration of all of the evidence that   the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements as I have   explained them, then your verdict should be guilty.</p>
<p>However, if the State has not proven each of the elements described above to   your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt, then your verdict should be not   guilty.</p>

<p>2C:20-2. Consolidation of Theft Offenses; Grading; Provisions Applicable to   Theft Generally. a. Consolidation of Theft Offenses. Conduct denominated theft   in this chapter constitutes a single offense, but each episode or transaction   may be the subject of a separate prosecution and conviction. A charge of theft   may be supported by evidence that it was committed in any manner that would be   theft under this chapter, notwithstanding the specification of a different   manner in the indictment or accusation, subject only to the power of the court   to ensure fair trial by granting a bill of particulars, discovery, a   continuance, or other appropriate relief where the conduct of the defense would   be prejudiced by lack of fair notice or by surprise.</p>
<p>b.Grading of theft offenses.</p>
<p>(1)Theft constitutes a crime of the second degree if:</p>
<p>(a)The amount involved is $75,000.00 or more;</p>

<p>(f)It is by threat not amounting to extortion;</p>

If   the driving privilege of any person is under revocation, suspension, or   postponement for a violation of any provision of this Title or Title 39 of the   Revised Statutes at the time of any conviction or adjudication of delinquency   for a violation of any offense defined in this chapter or chapter 36 of this   Title, the revocation, suspension, or postponement period imposed herein shall   commence as of the date of termination of the existing revocation, suspension,   or postponement.</p>
<p>Upon conviction the court shall collect forthwith the New Jersey drivers   licenses of the person and forward such license or licenses to the Director of   the Division of Motor Vehicles along with a report indicating the first and last   day of the suspension or postponement period imposed by the court pursuant to   this section. If the court is for any reason unable to collect the license or   licenses of the person, the court shall cause a report of the conviction or   adjudication of delinquency to be filed with the director. That report shall   include the complete name, address, date of birth, eye color, and sex of the   person and shall indicate the first and last day of the suspension or   postponement period imposed by the court pursuant to this section. The court   shall inform the person orally and in writing that if the person is convicted of   personally operating a motor vehicle during the period of license suspension or   postponement imposed pursuant to this section the person shall, upon conviction,   be subject to the penalties set forth in R.S.39:3-40. A person shall be required   to acknowledge receipt of the written notice in writing. Failure to receive a   written notice or failure to acknowledge in writing the receipt of a written   notice shall not be a defense to a subsequent charge of a violation of   R.S.39:3-40. If the person is the holder of a drivers license from another   jurisdiction, the court shall not collect the license but shall notify the   director who shall notify the appropriate officials in the licensing   jurisdiction.

However, the distributed monies are to   be used for law enforcement activities related to auto theft.</p>

<p>a. Creates or reinforces a false impression, including false impressions as   to law, value, intention or other state of mind; but deception as to a persons   intention to perform a promise shall not be inferred from the fact alone that he   did not subsequently perform the promise;</p>
<p>b. Prevents another from acquiring information which would affect his   judgment of a transaction; or</p>
<p>c. Fails to correct a false impression which the deceiver previously created   or reinforced, or which the deceiver knows to be influencing another to whom he   stands in a fiduciary or confidential relationship.</p>

Any dealer in property   who knew or should have known that the identifying features such as serial   numbers and permanently affixed labels of property in his possession have been   removed or altered without the consent of the manufacturer is guilty of   possession of altered property. It is a defense to a prosecution under this   subsection that a person lawfully possesses the usual indicia of ownership in   addition to mere possession.</p>
<p>b. Dealing in stolen property. A person is guilty of dealing in stolen   property if he traffics in, or initiates, organizes, plans, finances, directs,   manages or supervises trafficking in stolen property.</p>
<p>c. The value of the property involved in the violation of this section shall   be determined by the trier of fact. The value of the property involved in the   violation of this section may be aggregated in determining the grade of the   offense where the acts or conduct constituting a violation were committed   pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same person or   several persons.</p>
<p>d. It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that the   actor:</p>
<p>(1) Was unaware that the property or service was that of another;</p>
<p>(2) Acted under an honest claim of right to the property or service involved   or that he had a right to acquire or dispose of it as he did.</p>

<p>(1) Proof of the purchase or sale of property at a price substantially below   its fair market value, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an   inference that the person buying or selling the property knew that it had been   stolen;</p>
<p>(2) Proof of the purchase or sale of property by a dealer in that property,   out of the regular course of business, or without the usual indicia of ownership   other than mere possession, or the property or the job lot of which it is a part   was bought, received, possessed or controlled in broken succession of title, so   that it cannot be traced, by appropriate documents, in unbroken succession to   the manufacturer, in all cases where the regular course of business reasonably   indicates records of purchase, transfer or sale, unless satisfactorily   explained, gives rise to an inference that the person buying or selling the   property knew that it had been stolen; and</p>
<p>(3) Proof that a person buying or selling property of the sort received   obtained such property without having ascertained by reasonable inquiry that the   person from whom he obtained it had a legal right to possess or control it gives   rise to an inference that such person knew that it had been stolen.</p>
<p>L.1981, c. 167, s. 7, eff. June 15, 1981.</p>
<p>2C:20-8. Theft of services</p>
<p>2C:20-8. Theft of Services. a. A person is guilty of theft if he purposely   obtains services which he knows are available only for compensation, by   deception or threat, or by false token, slug, or other means, including but not   limited to mechanical or electronic devices or through fraudulent statements, to   avoid payment for the service. &quot;Services&quot; include labor or professional service;   transportation, telephone, telecommunications, electric, water, gas, cable   television, or other public service; accommodation in hotels, restaurants or   elsewhere; entertainment; admission to exhibitions; use of vehicles or other   movable property. Where compensation for service is ordinarily paid immediately   upon the rendering of such service, as in the case of hotels and restaurants,   absconding without payment or offer to pay gives rise to a presumption that the   service was obtained by deception as to intention to pay.</p>
<p>b. A person commits theft if, having control over the disposition of services   of another, to which he is not entitled, he knowingly diverts such services to   his own benefit or to the benefit of another not entitled thereto.</p>

<p>2C:20-9. Theft by failure to make required disposition of property received   Theft by Failure to Make Required Disposition of Property Received. A person who   purposely obtains or retains property upon agreement or subject to a known legal   obligation to make specified payment or other disposition, whether from such   property or its proceeds or from his own property to be reserved in equivalent   amount, is guilty of theft if he deals with the property obtained as his own and   fails to make the required payment or disposition. The foregoing applies   notwithstanding that it may be impossible to identify particular property as   belonging to the victim at the time of the actors failure to make the required   payment or disposition. An officer or employee of the government or of a   financial institution is presumed: (a) to know any legal obligation relevant to   his criminal liability under this section, and (b) to have dealt with the   property as his own if he fails to pay or account upon lawful demand, or if an   audit reveals a shortage or falsification of accounts. The fact that any payment   or other disposition was made with a subsequently dishonored negotiable   instrument shall constitute prima facie evidence of the actors failure to make   the required payment or disposition, and the trier of fact may draw a permissive   inference therefrom that the actor did not intend to make the required payment   or other disposition.</p>
