<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC helps people injured due to the   negligence of others. We provide representation throughout New Jersey. The   insurance companies will not help. Don't give up! Our Law Office can provide   experienced attorney representation if you are injured in an accident and suffer   a Serious Injury.</p>
<p>Even the most seasoned driver must be prepared at all times for the   unforeseen danger of automobile drivers who are not paying attention to the   road. Hopefully you will be able to maneuver around the danger but sometimes you   will not be that lucky.</p>
<p>If the other driver stops and exchanges pertinent accident information, you   have a good chance of recovering your damages...but what if they don't? There&rsquo;s   a likely chance that you may be involved in a HIT AND RUN at some point.   Unfortunately, many drivers currently using our roads are driving without   licenses or insurance, or had multiple suspensions. These circumstances make   them far more likely to leave the scene of the accident.<br />
  If you have been the   victim of a hit and run accident, there are a few things that you must   remember.</p>
<p>1. An altercation with the &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; may result in far more serious   problems.</p>
<p>2. If at all possible, get the license plate number of the vehicle.</p>
<p>3. Call 911 immediately. Provide the police with as much information as you   can about the other driver. Make, model, color of car, physical description of   the driver if you are able to see them, and most importantly, the direction they   are traveling. The police may issue a notice to nearby towns to pursue the   suspect vehicle and also send a unit to assist you.</p>
<p>4. Talk with as many witnesses as you can. Make sure you ask for their name,   address, and telephone number and ask them (beg if you must) to please wait for   the police to arrive so that they can give a statement while their memories are   fresh.</p>
<p>5. Protect the accident scene. Even the smallest piece of evidence could   carry a &ldquo;signature&rdquo; of the other driver. For example: lenses from headlights and   taillights (often smashed during the accident) carry a code from the DOT that   marks the make, model, and year of the vehicle. This evidence will certainly   help to narrow the search. Carry a small camera in your car. INSIST to the   police to write up a police report.<br />
  Increase your uninsured motorist coverage   on your insurance. If you are injured in a hit and run, we often are still able   to help you obtain money compensation from the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment   Fund or from your own insurance company. Most drivers in New Jersey have   uninsured motorist coverage to protect them if they are seriously injured in a   hit and run accident. Call the Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek to schedule an &ldquo;in-office&rdquo;   consultation. Bring your insurance declaration sheet, insurance policy, and the   accident report.</p>
