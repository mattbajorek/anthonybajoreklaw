<h1 align="center"><strong>Landlords - Evicting Tenants for Non-Payment of   Rent</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>This article will briefly explore certain remedies and recommendations to   landlords. Unlike big apartment complexes, many landlords in New Jersey do not   have full time management companies handling the collection of rent. Yet all   landlords should handle their payments as a business, just as big corporate   landlords.</p>
<p>WRITTEN LEASE A written lease is recommended for all rentals even for a month   to month. Your lease should specifically require that the tenant pay the   landlords attorneys fees if they fail to pay rent or breach the lease in any   way. If a written lease does not provide for attorneys fees, the court cannot   award attorneys fees. In addition, your lease should provide in writing for   re-renting cost if the tenant breaches the lease. Many leases also provide for   late fees.</p>
<p>NON-PAYMENT OF RENT If your tenant fails to pay and you want to evict the   tenant, a Tenancy Summons Dispossess Eviction Complaint must be filed in the   Supreme Courts Special Civil Part. The court filing fee is less than $50.   Different attorneys charge different fees depending upon the amount of work to   be done. Your attorney can prepare the mandatory complaint and summons. The   court constable is required to personally serve the tenant with a copy of the   complaint. The court clerk will fill out the date and time for hearing on the   summons, which also will be served on the tenant. You and your attorney should   appear on the date for hearing. If the tenant appears, parties sometimes work   out a payment plan for rent with a stipulation of settlement and stay of   eviction. The landlord and tenant usually agree if all rent is not paid   according to the schedule, the court is directed to issue a warrant for   possession.</p>
<p>FAILURE OF TENANT TO APPEAR If the tenant fails to appear by the second call,   you can pay an additional fee for a warrant of removal. This is obtained at the   Special Civil Part Clerk, Tenancy Section Office. After waiting three days, the   constable is given the warrant to serve at the tenants property. If the tenant   still fails to move, arrangements can be made with the constable and locksmith   to physically remove the tenants and change locks.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION OF PROPERTY Most residential units most be registered with the   town. It is a good idea to bring proof of registration when you go to court.</p>
<p>FILE A SPECIAL CIVIL PART COMPLAINT FOR MONEY OWED Most eviction complaints   are evictions based only on non-payment of rent. The New Jersey Anti-Eviction   Act places substantial notice requirement on landlords who wish to evict tenants   for reasons other than non-payment of rent. If the tenant is able to pay the   rent in full prior to warrant of possession, the court will let the tenant   remain in the property.</p>
<p>HOW TO GET YOUR MONEY The Tenancy Judge will not require the tenant to pay   attorneys fees, damages and other costs. This court can only evict tenants, or   permit tenants to remain if they paid the rent in full. To protect yourself and   get all money due, file a money owed complaint in the Special Civil Part. The   filing fee is less than $50.</p>

<p>2A:18-61.1a. Findings The Legislature finds that:</p>
<p>a. Acute State and local shortages of supply and high levels of demand for   residential dwellings have motivated removal of blameless tenants in order to   directly or indirectly profit from conversion to higher income rental or   ownership interest residential use.</p>
<p>b. This has resulted in unfortunate attempts to displace tenants employing   pretexts, stratagems or means other than those provided pursuant to the intent   of State eviction laws designated to fairly balance and protect rights of   tenants and landlords.</p>
<p>c. These devices have circumvented the intent of current State eviction laws   by failing to utilize available means to avoid displacement, such as: protected   tenancies; rights to purchase; rent affordability protection; full disclosures   relevant to eviction challenges; and stays of eviction where relocation is   lacking.</p>
<p>d. It is in the public interest of the State to maintain for citizens the   broadest protections available under State eviction laws to avoid such   displacement and resultant loss of affordable housing, which, due to housings   uniqueness as the most costly and difficult to change necessity of life, causes   overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary conditions, blight, burdens on community   services, wasted resources, homelessness, emigration from the State and personal   hardship, which is particularly severe for vulnerable seniors, the disabled, the   frail, minorities, large families and single parents.</p>
<p>e. Such personal hardship includes, but is not limited to: economic loss,   time loss, physical and emotional stress, and in some cases severe emotional   trauma, illness, homelessness or other irreparable harm resulting from strain of   eviction controversy; relocation search and moving difficulties; anxiety caused   by lack of information, uncertainty, and resultant planning difficulty;   employment, education, family and social disruption; relocation and empty unit   security hazards; relocation to premises of less affordability, capacity,   accessibility and physical or environmental quality; and relocation adjustment   problems, particularly of the blind or other disabled citizens.</p>
<p>f. It is appropriate to take legislative notice of relevant legislative   findings adopted pursuant to section 2 of the &quot;Senior Citizens and Disabled   Protected Tenancy Act,&quot; P.L. 1981, c. 226 (C. 2A:18-61.23) and section 2 of the   &quot;Prevention of Homelessness Act (1984),&quot; P.L. 1984, c. 180 (C. 52:27D-281),   which, with the findings of this section, have relevance to this 1986 amendatory   and supplementary act and P.L. 1974, c. 49 (C. 2A:18-61.1 et seq.).</p>
<p>g. This 1986 amendatory and supplementary act is adopted in order to protect   the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of New Jersey.</p>
<p>L. 1986, c. 138, s. 10, eff. Oct. 29, 1986.</p>
