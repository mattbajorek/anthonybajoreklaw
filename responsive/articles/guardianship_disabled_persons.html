<h1 align="center"><strong>Guardianship of Disabled Adults</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>Occasionally an individual can not manage his or her life as a result of a   mental or physical disability, alcohol or drug addiction. If a legally prepared   power of attorney was signed, a trusted family member, friend or professional   can legally act on that person's affairs. If a power of attorney was not signed,   your attorney must file a formal complaint and other legal pleadings in the   Superior Court to permit the trusted family member, friend or professional to be   able to handle financial affairs.</p>
<p>Powers of Attorney are generally given by one person to another so that if   the grantor of the power becomes ill or incapacitated, the Power of Attorney   will permit the holder of it to pay the grantor's bills and to handle the   grantor's affairs during the inability of the grantor to do the same.</p>
<p>A Power of Attorney is an appointment of another person as one's agent. A   Power of Attorney creates a principal-agent relationship. The grantor of the   Power of Attorney is the principal. The person to whom the Power of Attorney is   given is the agent. We give the title &quot;attorney-in-fact&quot; to the agent who is   given a Power of Attorney.</p>
<p>Without a legal Power of Attorney or court ordered guardianship, even a   spouse does not have the legal authority to sign their spouse's signature. If a   valid power of attorney is not legally prepared, signed and acknowledged in   front of an attorney or notary, it is invalid.</p>
<p>Without a power of attorney, a Guardianship Order and Judgment must be   obtained from the Superior Court to permit complete legal decision making.</p>
<p>According to Disability Law, A Legal Primer published by the New Jersey State   Bar Association, &quot;A guardian is a person appointed by a court to make financial   and personal decisions for a person proven to be legally incompetent.&quot; p11</p>
<p>1. When is a guardian needed? A guardian is needed when an individual can not   manage his or her life as a result of a mental or physical disability, alcohol   or drug addiction. The person for whom a guardian is appointed is called a   &quot;ward&quot;. Disability Law at p11</p>
<p>Recently the legislation changed the designation of &quot;mental incompetent&quot; to   &quot;incapacitated person&quot; in all laws, rules, regulations and documents.</p>
<p>2. What rights does a incompetent lose? Unless a Court orders otherwise, a   ward/ incompetent does not have the right to decide where to live, spend money,   use property, appear in Court or undergo medical treatment without the approval   of his or her guardian. An unmarried incompetent also loses the right to   marry.</p>
<p>3. How does somebody become the guardian of another? Guardians are appointed   by Courts after the person in need of guardianship is proven incompetent.   Guardianship actions can be brought under the general incompetency statute   (N.J.S.A. 3B:12-25 et seq.) or under the statute dealing with people who receive   services from the State Division of Developmental Disabilities. N.J.S.A..   30:4-165.4 et seq. Guardians who are married to the incompetent or are parents   of an unmarried incompetent can choose who will become the guardian after the   guardians die and include a clause designating their successor in their wills.   Disability Laws p12 Under the general incompetency statute, a Complaint   requesting Guardianship must be filed in the Superior Court, plus a detailed   Affidavit by the person requesting to be Guardian detailing the assets of the   incompetent plus reasons why the incompetent is no longer able to manage their   affairs. Affidavits of two doctors are also needed. The Court will appoint a   temporary attorney to interview the incompetent and prepare a report to the   Court.</p>
<p>4. Who can be a guardian? Generally, a close relative or a person with a   close relationship to the proposed incompetent who will act to protect the   incompetent's best interests can be guardian. when a close friend or relative is   not available, the Court may appoint the Public Guardian (for persons over 60)   or an Attorney to serve as guardian.</p>
<p>5. What are the rights of the proposed incompetent prior to hearing? The   proposed incompetent is entitled to receive advance notice of the guardianship   hearing, to be represented by a lawyer and to present a defense at the   hearing.</p>
<p>6. What happens if the incompetent regain the ability to manage his or her   affairs? The incompetent came then go back to Court and ask to be made his or   her own guardian again, but first must show that he or she has regained &quot;sound   reason&quot;.</p>
<p>7. When is a guardian not needed? Just because a person has a disability,   does not mean that they need a guardian. A guardian is not needed if a person   can make, and understands the nature of the decisions, and communicate the   decisions to others. A guardian is not required for someone who has a physical   disability, but who can manage his or her affairs, and is not needed if a person   merely has a problem managing money or property.
