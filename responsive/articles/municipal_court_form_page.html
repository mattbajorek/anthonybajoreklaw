<p>What you should do: After you have retained [paid] your attorney, call the court, plead not guilty. In traffic tickets, the phone number is on the back of the ticket. Judges will often ask you how many tickets you have had in the past 5 years. You want to be accurate with your response. In traffic matters we recommend you contact DMV, now Motor Vehicle Commission and obtain a drivers license abstract. Call 888-486-3339 or 609-292-6500. Please note the DMV/MVC only permits 2 &quot;no point&quot; downgrades in 5 years. If you have 2 downgrades to unsafe driving 39:4-97.2, you must wait 5 years for another downgrade to unsafe driving 39:4-97.2. If you do not wait 5 years, the MVC computer will impose 4 points against you.<br />
