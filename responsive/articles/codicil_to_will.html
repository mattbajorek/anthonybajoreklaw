<p>QUESTION #54: How can I change my will?</p>
<p>An individual can write a codicil to his or her will as long as   the<br />
  codicil meets certain requirements. The codicil must be signed<br />
  and   witnessed just as the original will was signed and witnessed. The<br />
  codicil   should refer to original will by date and should be<br />
  attached to the original   will. It is not recommended that an individual<br />
  attempt to draft a codicil. A   codicil should only be drafted<br />
  by an attorney to insure that it will have its   intended effect. If there<br />
  are numerous changes to the will, it is a good idea   to have a<br />
  new will drawn up and executed.</p>
