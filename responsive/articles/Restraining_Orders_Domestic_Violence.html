<p><strong>RESTRAINING ORDERS in  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE  CASES </strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>by  Kenneth A. Vercammen, Esq.</strong></p>
<p align="left">New Jersey domestic violence laws are very strict. If there are   any signs of physical injuries the police must arrest the abuser.  Even without   independent witnesses and  no physical injuries, police may arrest the abuser.    Domestic Violence is a crime under the law, and the police must respond to the   calls of victims. The police are required to give the victim information about   their rights and to help them. Among other things, police must write up a   report.  For example, O.J. Simpson would not have gotten away with abuse in New   Jersey. Police are automatically required to arrest an abuser if they see any   evidence of abuse or assault. Even during the evening, your town Municipal Court   or Superior Court can issue a civil restraining order which is a legally   enforceable document. The temporary restraining order will prohibit the   defendant/abuser from harassing you or entering your residence.    Unlike a   criminal case where a person is provided with lengthy due process, and if guilty   receives probation and a monetary fine, a domestic violence hearing  allows   judges to issue far reaching orders.  A domestic violence hearing is usually   held within only ten (10) days of the filing of an ex parte complaint and   temporary restraining order.  After a hearing , NJSA 2C:25-29 (b) allows the   Chancery Division, Family Part Judge to grant substantial relief to the   complainant.  Among the relief the Court may gives is:</p>
<p align="left">(1) An order restraining the defendant from subjecting the victim   to domestic violence, as defined in this act.</p>
<p align="left">(2) An order granting exclusive possession to the plaintiff of the   residence or household regardless of whether the residence or household is   jointly or solely owned by the parties or jointly or solely leased by the   parties...</p>
<p align="left">(3) An order providing for visitation...[ meaning the complainant   obtains custody]</p>
<p align="left">(4) An order requiring the defendant to pay to the victim monetary   compensation for losses suffered as a direct result of the act of domestic   violence...</p>
<p align="left">(6) An order restraining the defendant from entering the   residence, property, school, or place of employment of the victim or of other   family or household members of the victim...</p>
<p align="left">(7) An order restraining the defendant from making any   communication likely to cause annoyance or alarm...</p>
<p align="left">(8) An order requiring that the defendant make or continue to make   rent or mortgage payments on the residence occupied by the victim if the   defendant is found to have a duty to support the victim or other dependent   household members...</p>
<p align="left">(9) An order granting either party temporary possession of   specified personal property, such as an automobile, checkbook, documentation of   health insurance, any identification documents, a key, and other personal   effects.</p>
<p align="left">(10) An order awarding emergent monetary relief to the victim and   other dependents, if any.  An ongoing obligation of support shall be determined   at a later date pursuant to applicable law...Â²</p>
<p align="left">(11) An Order awarding temporary custody of a minor child. The   court shall presume that the best interests of the child shall be served by an   award of custody to the non- abusive parent.</p>
<p align="left">(12) An Order requiring that a law enforcement officer accompany   either party to the residence to supervise the removal of personal   belongings.</p>
<p align="left">(13) An Order granting any other appropriate relief for the   plaintiff and minor children</p>
<p align="left">(14) An Order that the defendant report to the intake office of   the Family Part for monitoring</p>
<p align="left">(15) An Order prohibiting the defendant from possessing any   firearm or weapon</p>
<p align="left">Caselaw protects victims. In Pepe v Pepe, 258 N.J. Super. 157   (Chan. Div. 1992) held that the confidentiality provision of record keeping   under the Domestic Violence act applies to the records kept on file with the   Clerk of the Superior Court.The court held that in determining whether or not a   statutory imposed confidential record should be made public, the court must   consider whether the release of the documents will be harmful to the victim,   whether adverse publicity will be a factor and whether access to court records   will discourage the victim from coming forward.Despite the substantial financial   burden and life restrictions (often referred to as penalties), the burden of   proof in a DOMESTIC VIOLENCE hearing is only Â³by a preponderance of   evidence.Â²  Hopefully, parties will put best interests of children ahead of   short term animosity.  Financial limitations often limit the family ability to   become involved in lengthy divorce and custody battles.</p>
<p align="left">A  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE complaint can be withdrawn. For additional   information, speak with an attorney experienced in handling Domestic Violence   matters. The following is the NJ Court Rule on Restraining Orders; Court Rule   5:7A. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: RESTRAINING ORDERS (a) Application for Temporary   Restraining Order except as provided in paragraph (b) herein, an applicant for a   temporary restraining order shall appear before a judge personally to testify   upon the record or by sworn complaint submitted pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:25-28.   If it appears that the applicant is in danger of domestic violence, the judge   shall, upon consideration of the applicants domestic violence affidavit,   complaint or testimony, order emergency relief including ex parte relief, in the   nature of a temporary restraining order as authorized by N.J.S.A. 2C:25-17 et   seq. (b) Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order by Electronic Communication. A   judge may issue a temporary restraining order upon sworn oral testimony of an   applicant who is not physically present. Such sworn oral testimony may be   communicated to the judge by telephone, radio or other means of electronic   communication. The judge or law enforcement officer assisting the applicant   shall contemporaneously record such sworn oral testimony by means of a   tape-recording device or stenographic machine if such are available; otherwise,   adequate long hand notes summarizing what is said shall be made by the judge.   Subsequent to taking the oath, the applicant must identify himself or herself,   specify the purpose of the request and disclose the basis of the application.   This sworn testimony shall be deemed to be an affidavit for the purposes of   issuance of a temporary restraining order. A temporary restraining order may   issue if the judge is satisfied that exigent circumstances exist sufficient to   excuse the failure of the applicant to appear personally and that sufficient   grounds for granting the application have been shown. Upon issuance of the   temporary restraining order, the judge shall memorialize the specific terms of   the order and shall direct the law enforcement officer assisting the applicant   to enter the judges authorization verbatim on a form, or other appropriate   paper, designated the duplicate original temporary restraining order. This order   shall be deemed a temporary restraining order for the purpose of N.J.S.A.   2C:25-28. The judge shall direct the law enforcement officer assisting applicant   to print the judges name on the temporary restraining order. The judge shall   also contemporaneously record factual determinations. Contemporaneously the   judge shall issue a written confirmatory order and shall enter thereon the exact   time of issuance of the duplicate order. In all other respects, the method of   issuance and contents of the order shall be that required by sub-section (a) of   this rule. (c) Temporary Restraining Order. In court proceedings instituted   under the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1990, the judge shall issue a   temporary restraining order when the applicant appears to be in danger of   domestic violence. The order may be issued ex parte when necessary to protect   the life, health, or well-being of a victim on whose behalf the relief is   sought. (d) Final Restraining Order. A final order restraining a defendant shall   be issued only on a specific finding of domestic violence or on a stipulation by   a defendant to the commission of an act or acts of domestic violence as defined   by the statute. (e) Procedure Upon Arrest Without a Warrant. Whenever a law   enforcement officer has effected an arrest without a warrant on a criminal   complaint brought for a violation otherwise defined as an offense under the   Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, N.J.S.A. 2C:25-17 et seq., bail may be set   and a complaint-warrant may be issued pursuant to the procedures prescribed in R   3:4-1(b). (f) Venue in Domestic Violence Proceedings. Venue in domestic violence   actions shall be laid in the county where either of the parties resides, in the   county where the domestic violence offense took place, or in the county where   the victim of domestic violence is sheltered. If the action is not brought in a   county of residence, venue shall be transferred to a county of residence for the   final hearing unless the court orders the matter retained in the county where   the complaint is filed for good cause shown. The following is the NJ Statute on   Restraining Orders and Domestic Violence Matters 2C:25-17. Short title 1. This   act shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;Prevention of Domestic Violence Act   of 1991.&quot; 2C:25-18. Findings, declarations 2. The Legislature finds and declares   that domestic violence is a serious crime against society; that there are   thousands of persons in this State who are regularly beaten, tortured and in   some cases even killed by their spouses or cohabitants; that a significant   number of women who are assaulted are pregnant; that victims of domestic   violence come from all social and economic backgrounds and ethnic groups; that   there is a positive correlation between spousal abuse and child abuse; and that   children, even when they are not themselves physically assaulted, suffer deep   and lasting emotional effects from exposure to domestic violence. It is   therefore, the intent of the Legislature to assure the victims of domestic   violence the maximum protection from abuse the law can provide. The Legislature   further finds and declares that the health and welfare of some of its most   vulnerable citizens, the elderly and disabled, are at risk because of incidents   of reported and unreported domestic violence, abuse and neglect which are known   to include acts which victimize the elderly and disabled emotionally,   psychologically, physically and financially; because of age, disabilities or   infirmities, this group of citizens frequently must rely on the aid and support   of others; while the institutionalized elderly are protected under P.L. 1977,   c.239 (C. 52:27G-1 et seq.), elderly and disabled adults in non   institutionalized or community settings may find themselves victimized by family   members or others upon whom they feel compelled to depend. The Legislature   further finds and declares that violence against the elderly and disabled,   including criminal neglect of the elderly and disabled under section 1 of P.L.   1989, c.23 (C. 2C:24-8), must be recognized and addressed on an equal basis as   violence against spouses and children in order to fulfill our responsibility as   a society to protect those who are less able to protect themselves. The   Legislature further finds and declares that even though many of the existing   criminal statutes are applicable to acts of domestic violence, previous societal   attitudes concerning domestic violence have affected the response of our law   enforcement and judicial systems, resulting in these acts receiving different   treatment from similar crimes when they occur in a domestic context. The   Legislature finds that battered adults presently experience substantial   difficulty in gaining access to protection from the judicial system,   particularly due to that systems inability to generate a prompt response in an   emergency situation. It is the intent of the Legislature to stress that the   primary duty of a law enforcement officer when responding to a domestic violence   call is to enforce the laws allegedly violated and to protect the victim.   Further, it is the responsibility of the courts to protect victims of violence   that occurs in a family or family-like setting by providing access to both   emergent and long-term civil and criminal remedies and sanctions, and by   ordering those remedies and sanctions that are available to assure the safety of   the victims and the public. To that end, the Legislature encourages the training   of all police and judicial personnel in the procedures and enforcement of this   act, and about the social and psychological context in which domestic violence   occurs; and it further encourages the broad application of the remedies   available under this act in the civil and criminal courts of this State. It is   further intended that the official response to domestic violence shall   communicate the attitude that violent behavior will not be excused or tolerated,   and shall make clear the fact that the existing criminal laws and civil remedies   created under this act will be enforced without regard to the fact that the   violence grows out of a domestic situation. 2C:25-21.1 Rules, regulations   concerning weapons prohibitions and domestic violence. The Attorney General may   adopt, pursuant to the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L. 1968, c.410 (C.   52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations necessary and appropriate to implement   this act.</p>
<p align="left">2C:25-22. Immunity from civil liability A law enforcement officer   or a member of a domestic crisis team or any person who, in good faith, reports   a possible incident of domestic violence to the police shall not be held liable   in any civil action brought by any party for an arrest based on probable cause,   enforcement in good faith of a court order, or any other act or omission in good   faith under this act.</p>
<p align="left">2C:25-23. Dissemination of notice to victim of domestic violence   7. A law enforcement officer shall disseminate and explain to the victim the   following notice, which shall be written in both English and Spanish: &quot;You have   the right to go to court to get an order called a temporary restraining order,   also called a TRO, which may protect you from more abuse by your attacker. The   officer who handed you this card can tell you how to get a TRO. The kinds of   things a judge can order in a TRO may include: (1) That your attacker is   temporarily forbidden from entering the home you live in;</p>
<p align="left">(2) That your attacker is temporarily forbidden from having   contact with you or your relatives;</p>
<p align="left">(3) That your attacker is temporarily forbidden from bothering you   at work;</p>
<p align="left">(4) That your attacker has to pay temporary child support or   support for you;</p>
<p align="left">(5) That you be given temporary custody of your children;</p>
<p align="left">(6) That your attacker pay you back any money you have to spend   for medical treatment or repairs because of the violence. There are other things   the court can order, and the court clerk will explain the procedure to you and   will help you fill out the papers for a TRO.</p>
<p align="left">You also have the right to file a criminal complaint against your   attacker. The police officer who gave you this paper will tell you how to file a   criminal complaint. On weekends, holidays and other times when the courts are   closed, you still have a right to get a TRO. The police officer who gave you   this paper can help you get in touch with a judge who can give you a TRO.&quot;   2C:25-24 Domestic violence offense reports. 8.</p>
<p align="left">a. It shall be the duty of a law enforcement officer who responds   to a domestic violence call to complete a domestic violence offense report. All   information contained in the domestic violence offense report shall be forwarded   to the appropriate county bureau of identification and to the State bureau of   records and identification in the Division of State Police in the Department of   Law and Public Safety. A copy of the domestic violence offense report shall be   forwarded to the municipal court where the offense was committed unless the case   has been transferred to the Superior Court. b. The domestic violence offense   report shall be on a form prescribed by the supervisor of the State bureau of   records and identification which shall include, but not be limited to, the   following information:</p>
<p align="left">(1)The relationship of the parties;</p>
<p align="left">(2)The sex of the parties;</p>
<p align="left">(3)The time and date of the incident;</p>
<p align="left">(4)The number of domestic violence calls investigated;</p>
<p align="left">(5)Whether children were involved, or whether the alleged act of   domestic violence had been committed in the presence of children;</p>
<p align="left">(6)The type and extent of abuse;</p>
<p align="left">(7)The number and type of weapons involved;</p>
<p align="left">(8)The action taken by the law enforcement officer;</p>
<p align="left">(9)The existence of any prior court orders issued pursuant to this   act concerning the parties;</p>
<p align="left">(10) The number of domestic violence calls alleging a violation of   a domestic violence restraining order;</p>
<p align="left">(11) The number of arrests for a violation of a domestic violence   order; and</p>
<p align="left">(12) Any other data that may be necessary for a complete analysis   of all circumstances leading to the alleged incident of domestic violence. c. It   shall be the duty of the Superintendent of the State Police with the assistance   of the Division of Systems and Communications in the Department of Law and   Public Safety to compile and report annually to the Governor, the Legislature   and the Advisory Council on Domestic Violence on the tabulated data from the   domestic violence offense reports, classified by county 2C:25-25. Criminal   complaints; proceedings 9. The court in a criminal complaint arising from a   domestic violence incident: a. Shall not dismiss any charge or delay disposition   of a case because of concurrent dissolution of a marriage, other civil   proceedings, or because the victim has left the residence to avoid further   incidents of domestic violence; b. Shall not require proof that either party is   seeking a dissolution of a marriage prior to institution of criminal   proceedings; c. Shall waive any requirement that the victims location be   disclosed to any person.</p>
<p align="left">2C:25-26 Release of defendant before trial; conditions. 10. a.   When a defendant charged with a crime or offense involving domestic violence is   released from custody before trial on bail or personal recognizance, the court   authorizing the release may as a condition of release issue an order prohibiting   the defendant from having any contact with the victim including, but not limited   to, restraining the defendant from entering the victims residence, place of   employment or business, or school, and from harassing or stalking the victim or   victims relatives in any way. The court may enter an order prohibiting the   defendant from possessing any firearm or other weapon enumerated in subsection   r. of N.J.S. 2C:39-1 and ordering the search for and seizure of any such weapon   at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the weapon is   located. The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and scope of the   search and seizure authorized by the order. b. The written court order releasing   the defendant shall contain the courts directives specifically restricting the   defendants ability to have contact with the victim or the victims friends,   co-workers or relatives. The clerk of the court or other person designated by   the court shall provide a copy of this order to the victim forthwith. c. The   victims location shall remain confidential and shall not appear on any documents   or records to which the defendant has access. d. Before bail is set, the   defendants prior record shall be considered by the court. The court shall also   conduct a search of the domestic violence central registry. Bail shall be set as   soon as it is feasible, but in all cases within 24 hours of arrest. e. Once bail   is set it shall not be reduced without prior notice to the county prosecutor and   the victim. Bail shall not be reduced by a judge other than the judge who   originally ordered bail, unless the reasons for the amount of the original bail   are available to the judge who reduces the bail and are set forth in the record.   f. A victim shall not be prohibited from applying for, and a court shall not be   prohibited from issuing, temporary restraints pursuant to this act because the   victim has charged any person with commission of a criminal act.</p>
<p align="left">2C:25-26.1. Notification of victim of release of defendant 1.   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, whenever a defendant   charged with a crime or an offense involving domestic violence is released from   custody the prosecuting agency shall notify the victim.</p>
<p align="left">2C:25-27 Conditions of sentencing of defendant found guilty of   domestic violence. 11. When a defendant is found guilty of a crime or offense   involving domestic violence and a condition of sentence restricts the defendants   ability to have contact with the victim, that condition shall be recorded in an   order of the court and a written copy of that order shall be provided to the   victim by the clerk of the court or other person designated by the court. In   addition to restricting a defendants ability to have contact with the victim,   the court may require the defendant to receive professional counseling from   either a private source or a source appointed by the court, and if the court so   orders, the court shall require the defendant to provide documentation of   attendance at the professional counseling. In any case where the court order   contains a requirement that the defendant receive professional counseling, no   application by the defendant to dissolve the restraining order shall be granted   unless, in addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions   ordered by the court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at   such counseling.</p>
<p align="left">2C:25-28 Filing complaint alleging domestic violence in Family   Part; proceedings. 12. a. A victim may file a complaint alleging the commission   of an act of domestic violence with the Family Part of the Chancery Division of   the Superior Court in conformity with the Rules of Court. The court shall not   dismiss any complaint or delay disposition of a case because the victim has left   the residence to avoid further incidents of domestic violence. Filing a   complaint pursuant to this section shall not prevent the filing of a criminal   complaint for the same act. On weekends, holidays and other times when the court   is closed, a victim may file a complaint before a judge of the Family Part of   the Chancery Division of the Superior Court or a municipal court judge who shall   be assigned to accept complaints and issue emergency, ex parte relief in the   form of temporary restraining orders pursuant to this act. A plaintiff may apply   for relief under this section in a court having jurisdiction over the place   where the alleged act of domestic violence occurred, where the defendant   resides, or where the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and the court shall   follow the same procedures applicable to other emergency applications. Criminal   complaints filed pursuant to this act shall be investigated and prosecuted in   the jurisdiction where the offense is alleged to have occurred. Contempt   complaints filed pursuant to N.J.S. 2C:29-9 shall be prosecuted in the county   where the contempt is alleged to have been committed and a copy of the contempt   complaint shall be forwarded to the court that issued the order alleged to have   been violated. b. The court shall waive any requirement that the petitioners   place of residence appear on the complaint. c. The clerk of the court, or other   person designated by the court, shall assist the parties in completing any forms   necessary for the filing of a summons, complaint, answer or other pleading. d.   Summons and complaint forms shall be readily available at the clerks office, at   the municipal courts and at municipal and State police stations. e. As soon as   the domestic violence complaint is filed, both the victim and the abuser shall   be advised of any programs or services available for advice and counseling. f. A   plaintiff may seek emergency, ex parte relief in the nature of a temporary   restraining order. A municipal court judge or a judge of the Family Part of the   Chancery Division of the Superior Court may enter an ex parte order when   necessary to protect the life, health or well-being of a victim on whose behalf   the relief is sought. g. If it appears that the plaintiff is in danger of   domestic violence, the judge shall, upon consideration of the plaintiffs   domestic violence complaint, order emergency ex parte relief, in the nature of a   temporary restraining order. A decision shall be made by the judge regarding the   emergency relief forthwith. h. A judge may issue a temporary restraining order   upon sworn testimony or complaint of an applicant who is not physically present,   pursuant to court rules, or by a person who represents a person who is   physically or mentally incapable of filing personally. A temporary restraining   order may be issued if the judge is satisfied that exigent circumstances exist   sufficient to excuse the failure of the applicant to appear personally and that   sufficient grounds for granting the application have been shown. i. An order for   emergency, ex parte relief shall be granted upon good cause shown and shall   remain in effect until a judge of the Family Part issues a further order. Any   temporary order hereunder is immediately appealable for a plenary hearing de   novo not on the record before any judge of the Family Part of the county in   which the plaintiff resides or is sheltered if that judge issued the temporary   order or has access to the reasons for the issuance of the temporary order and   sets forth in the record the reasons for the modification or dissolution. The   denial of a temporary restraining order by a municipal court judge and   subsequent administrative dismissal of the complaint shall not bar the victim   from refiling a complaint in the Family Part based on the same incident and   receiving an emergency, ex parte hearing de novo not on the record before a   Family Part judge, and every denial of relief by a municipal court judge shall   so state. j. Emergency relief may include forbidding the defendant from   returning to the scene of the domestic violence, forbidding the defendant from   possessing any firearm or other weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.   2C:39-1, ordering the search for and seizure of any such weapon at any location   where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the weapon is located and the   seizure of any firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a   handgun issued to the defendant and any other appropriate relief. The judge   shall state with specificity the reasons for and scope of the search and seizure   authorized by the order. The provisions of this subsection prohibiting a   defendant from possessing a firearm or other weapon shall not apply to any law   enforcement officer while actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces   of the United States or member of the National Guard while actually on duty or   traveling to or from an authorized place of duty. k. The judge may permit the   defendant to return to the scene of the domestic violence to pick up personal   belongings and effects but shall, in the order granting relief, restrict the   time and duration of such permission and provide for police supervision of such   visit. l.  An order granting emergency relief, together with the complaint or   complaints, shall immediately be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement   agency for service on the defendant, and to the police of the municipality in   which the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and shall immediately be served   upon the defendant by the police, except that an order issued during regular   court hours may be forwarded to the sheriff for immediate service upon the   defendant in accordance with the Rules of Court. If personal service cannot be   effected upon the defendant, the court may order other appropriate substituted   service. At no time shall the plaintiff be asked or required to serve any order   on the defendant. m.(Deleted by amendment, P.L. 1994, c.94.) n. Notice of   temporary restraining orders issued pursuant to this section shall be sent by   the clerk of the court or other person designated by the court to the   appropriate chiefs of police, members of the State Police and any other   appropriate law enforcement agency or court. o.(Deleted by amendment, P.L. 1994,   c.94.) p. Any temporary or permanent restraining order issued pursuant to this   act shall be in effect throughout the State, and shall be enforced by all law   enforcement officers. q. Prior to the issuance of any temporary or permanent   restraining order issued pursuant to this section, the court shall order that a   search be made of the domestic violence central registry with regard to the   defendants record.</p>
<p align="left">2C:25-28.1. In-house restraining order prohibited 2.   Notwithstanding any provision of P.L. 1991, c.261 (C. 2C:25-17 et seq.) to the   contrary, no order issued by the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the   Superior Court pursuant to section 12 or section 13 of P.L. 1991, c.261 (C.   2C:25-28 or 2C:25-29) regarding emergency, temporary or final relief shall   include an in-house restraining order which permits the victim and the defendant   to occupy the same premises but limits the defendants use of that premises.</p>
<p align="left">2C:25-29 Hearing procedure; relief. 13. a. A hearing shall be held   in the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court within 10 days   of the filing of a complaint pursuant to section 12 of P.L. 1991, c.261 (C.   2C:25-28) in the county where the ex parte restraints were ordered, unless good   cause is shown for the hearing to be held elsewhere. A copy of the complaint   shall be served on the defendant in conformity with the Rules of Court. If a   criminal complaint arising out of the same incident which is the subject matter   of a complaint brought under P.L. 1981, c.426 (C. 2C:25-1 et seq.) or P.L. 1991,   c.261 (C. 2C:25-17 et seq.) has been filed, testimony given by the plaintiff or   defendant in the domestic violence matter shall not be used in the simultaneous   or subsequent criminal proceeding against the defendant, other than domestic   violence contempt matters and where it would otherwise be admissible hearsay   under the rules of evidence that govern where a party is unavailable. At the   hearing the standard for proving the allegations in the complaint shall be by a   preponderance of the evidence. The court shall consider but not be limited to   the following factors:</p>
<p align="left">(1)The previous history of domestic violence between the plaintiff   and defendant, including threats, harassment and physical abuse;</p>
<p align="left">(2)The existence of immediate danger to person or property;</p>
<p align="left">(3)The financial circumstances of the plaintiff and defendant;</p>
<p align="left">(4)The best interests of the victim and any child;</p>
<p align="left">(5)In determining custody and parenting time the protection of the   victims safety; and</p>
<p align="left">(6)The existence of a verifiable order of protection from another   jurisdiction.    An order issued under this act shall only restrain or provide   damages payable from a person against whom a complaint has been filed under this   act and only after a finding or an admission is made that an act of domestic   violence was committed by that person. The issue of whether or not a violation   of this act occurred, including an act of contempt under this act, shall not be   subject to mediation or negotiation in any form. In addition, where a temporary   or final order has been issued pursuant to this act, no party shall be ordered   to participate in mediation on the issue of custody or parenting time.</p>
<p align="left">b. In proceedings in which complaints for restraining orders have   been filed, the court shall grant any relief necessary to prevent further abuse.   In addition to any other provisions, any restraining order issued by the court   shall bar the defendant from purchasing, owning, possessing or controlling a   firearm and from receiving or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card   or permit to purchase a handgun pursuant to N.J.S. 2C:58-3 during the period in   which the restraining order is in effect or two years whichever is greater,   except that this provision shall not apply to any law enforcement officer while   actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or   member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to or from an   authorized place of duty. At the hearing the judge of the Family Part of the   Chancery Division of the Superior Court may issue an order granting any or all   of the following relief:</p>
<p align="left">(1) An order restraining the defendant from subjecting the victim   to domestic violence, as defined in this act.</p>
