<h1 align="center"><strong>Ten Estate Planning Ideas for Divorced or Separated   Persons</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>Under the law in New Jersey, if a person dies without a Will and without   children, their spouse will inherit all assets, even if they are separated from   the spouse. In addition, if you have children from a previous marriage, but no   Will, your separated spouse will get half your estate. In planning, make sure   your assets go to your loved ones or favorite charity. Therefore, you may wish   to do the following:</p>
<p>1) Have an Elder Law attorney prepare a Will to distribute your assets to the   people you care the most about. If you already have a Will, prepare a new Will   and have the old Will revoked. ( Your estate planning attorney will explain this   to you.)</p>
<p>2) Prepare a Power of Attorney to select someone to handle your finances if   you become disabled. Have your old power of attorney revoked.</p>
<p>3) Prepare a Living Will prepared</p>
<p>4) Change your beneficiary on assets you may own, such as stocks, bank   accounts, IRA, and other financial assets. Change your beneficiary under your   own life insurance, whether whole life insurance or term insurance.</p>
<p>5) Contact your employer's human resources and change the beneficiary on life   insurance, pension, stock options or other employee benefits. Note that if you   are not yet divorced, your spouse may have to sign a written waiver permitting   you to change beneficiaries.</p>
<p>6) Keep your personal papers at a location where family can find them.</p>
<p>7) Have your attorney prepare a prenuptial agreement if you decide to get   married.</p>
<p>8) Make sure the trustee for any funds designated for your children is the   right trustee.</p>
<p>9) In New Jersey, if you are married and living with your spouse, under   certain instances the surviving spouse has a right to elect against the Will The   disinherited spouse may like to elect against the Will and try to obtain one   third of the estate. Your attorney can explain how you can protect yourself and   your children.</p>
<p>10) If you have minor children, nominate someone under a Will to serve as   guardian to the children. Although the surviving parent obviously has first   right of custody of children, they may not even want custody.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Planning can only be done if someone is competent and/or alive. Make sure   your assets can be passed directly to your loved ones.</p>
