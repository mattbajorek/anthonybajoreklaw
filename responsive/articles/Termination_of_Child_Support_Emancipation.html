<h1 align="center"><strong>Termination of Child Support upon Emancipation in New   Jersey</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>Child support is usually paid through a wage withholding garnishment at the   parents job. Child support orders and wage withholding continue forever against   you until a Superior Court Judge signs a Formal Court Order terminating or   modifying support. It is not sufficient for you to simply wait for a child to   finish school. Many Divorce decrees and Property Settlement Agreements state   that child support will end upon emancipation. For example, the term   &quot;emancipation&quot; is sometimes defined as follows: (i) The completion of the childs   formal education on a matriculated basis, whether it be graduation from a four   year undergraduate school or high school, it being understood that so long as   the child is diligently pursuing his formal education through a four year   undergraduate college education and obtaining passing grades the child shall not   be considered emancipated. (ii) Upon the completion of any of the aforesaid   segments of the childs education, and upon the failure to commence the next   segment of his education, or upon leaving school, the child shall be deemed   emancipated unless failure to continue on with his education has resulted from   injury or illness or some other cause beyond the childs control. (iii) The   marriage of the child. (iv) Entry into the military or armed forces by the   child.</p>
<p>Your attorney can draft the appropriate Motion to terminate child support if   the child is emancipated. You will need to provide your attorney with relevant   papers including a copy of the Final Judgment for Divorce, any other Child   Support Orders, copy of birth certificate if available, proof of graduation from   school or working full time, etc. Sometimes the child support recipient, usually   the mother, will sign a Consent Order which your attorney can file without the   need for a formal Motion. However, generally a Formal written Notice of Motion   must be filed in the County Superior Court where the child support Order was   entered. The requirements of the Motion are detailed and must include the   correct filing fees. Child support does not end merely if the child reaches 18   and graduates high school. Most child support Order continue child support if   the child is in college full time. However, dont give up. In the unreported   Appellate Division decision of Kozak v Kozak __ NJ Super. __ (App. Div. decided   January 9, 2003) the court reduced child support during the period of time the   child resided at the college campus. The judge properly determined it was   appropriate to calculate child support only for the period of time the child was   not residing at college.</p>
<p>The Motion will need to include the following type of language: PLEASE TAKE   NOTICE that the undersigned, attorney for payor parent, will apply to the above   named court, at the Court House, on [motion date] for an Order directing that   child support payments shall end since the child is now of legal age and   emancipated. PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that the undersigned shall rely upon the   Certification of payor in support of this motion.</p>
