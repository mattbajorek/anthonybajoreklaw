Uninsured and Underinsured Injury Cases. Injured Persons   Obtaining Money Recovery if Negligent Drivers Don¹t Have Adequate Insurance.
<p>Most injuries to drivers involved in multi-vehicle accidents are the fault of   the other driver and, even though you may have adequate insurance coverage, the   responsible party may not.</p>
<p>New Jersey law generally requires a driver to have:</p>
<p>$15,000 for injury or death of 1 person per accident.</p>
<p>$30,000 for injury or death of 2 or more persons per accident.</p>
<p>$5,000 for property damage per accident.</p>
<p>However, New Jersey also permits the sale of a new ³basic² policy which   essentially provides no coverage at all if someone is injured.</p>
<p>&quot;Uninsured motorist&quot; means that the person responsible for your injuries is   operating a vehicle without any insurance coverage whatsoever. If you have   purchased uninsured motorist coverage, you will be able to collect from your   insurance company to recoup your damages (both property and personal).</p>
<p>&quot;Underinsured motorist&quot; means that the person responsible for your injuries   has opted to purchase only the minimum policy required by law. If you have   purchased underinsured motorist coverage, you will be able to collect from your   insurance company to recoup your damages (both property and personal) that   exceed the responsible party's limits. We can often help you if you are   seriously injured and the defendant has minimal coverage or was uninsured.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you carry insurance that includes &quot;uninsured motorist&quot;   coverage and &quot;underinsured motorist&quot; coverage.</p>
<p>Drivers are responsible to pay for catastrophic injuries. You must protect   your interests and your future by making sure that your insurance policy   includes protection against drivers who are irresponsible.</p>
<p>In the event that you have been hit and injured by someone who carries only   the minimum policy required by law, or even worse someone who has no insurance   coverage at all, you must protect yourself. Never drive or ride without   insurance and never purchase insurance without including high uninsured motorist   coverage and underinsured motorist coverage. The nominal fee that insurance   companies charge for the extra coverage may save you thousands of dollars in the   long run.</p>
<p>&quot;We strongly recommend that every person carry a minimum of $300,000 in   uninsured/underinsured coverage. This is the insurance you carry that protects   YOU, not the other guy - who's more important? The cost is minimal and the   benefits to you if you need it can protect you against devastation.&quot;</p>
