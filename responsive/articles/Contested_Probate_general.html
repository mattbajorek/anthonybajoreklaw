<p align="center">
<p>Do you think youre entitled to money or might be entitled to money from an   estate or trust? Do you believe that someone is unfairly claiming money or   property that is rightfully yours? Has The Executor of Adminsitration of The   Estate not done their job? If so, and you are a prospective plaintiff or   defendant, then you may need an attorney to protect your rights.</p>
<p><strong>Executor Duties and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>At some point in time, you may be asked to serve as the executor of the   estate of a relative or friend, or you may ask someone to serve as your   executor. An executors job comes with many legal obligations. Under certain   circumstances, an executor can even be held personally liable for unpaid estate   taxes. Lets review the major duties involved, which weve set out below.</p>
<p>In General, the executors job is to</p>
<p>1. Administer the estate--i.e., collect and manage assets, file tax returns   and pay taxes and debts--and 2. Distribute any assets or make any distributions   of bequests, whether personal or charitable in nature, as the deceased directed   (under the provisions of the will).</p>
<p>Lets take a look at some of the specific steps involved and what these   responsibilities can mean. Chronological order of the various duties may   vary.</p>
<p>Step 1: Probate. The executor must &quot;probate&quot; the will. Probate is a process   by which a will is admitted. This means that the will is given legal effect by   the court. The courts decision that the will was validly executed under state   law gives the executor the power to perform his or her duties under the   provisions of the will.</p>
<p>Step 2: Manage the Estate. The executor takes legal title to the assets in   the probate estate. The probate court will sometimes require a public accounting   of the estate assets. The assets of the estate must be found and may have to be   collected. As part of the asset management function, the executor may have to   liquidate or run a business or manage a securities portfolio. To sell marketable   securities or real estate, the executor will have to obtain stock power, tax   waivers, file affidavits, and so on.</p>
<p>Step 3: Take Care of Tax Matters. The executor is legally responsible for   filing necessary income and estate-tax returns (federal and state) and for   paying all death taxes (i.e., estate and inheritance). The executor can, in some   cases be held personally liable for unpaid taxes of the estate. Tax returns that   will need to be filed can include the estates income tax return (both federal   and state), the federal estate-tax return, the state death tax return (estate   and/or inheritance), and the deceaseds final income tax return (federal and   state). Taxes usually must be paid before other debts. In many instances,   federal estate-tax returns are not needed as the size of the estate will be   under the amount for which a federal estate-tax return is required.</p>
<p>An employer identification number (&quot;EIN&quot;) should be obtained for the estate;   this number must be included on all returns and other tax documents having to do   with the estate. The executor should also file a written notice with the IRS   that he/she is serving as the fiduciary of the estate. This gives the executor   the authority to deal with the IRS on the estates behalf.</p>
<p>Often it is necessary to hire an appraiser to value certain assets of the   estate, such as a business, pension, or real estate, since estate taxes are   based on the &quot;fair market&quot; value of the assets. After the filing of the returns   and payment of taxes, the Internal Revenue Service will generally send some type   of estate closing letter accepting the return. Occasionally, the return will be   audited.</p>
<p>Step 4: Pay the Debts. The claims of the estates creditors must be paid.   Sometimes a claim must be litigated to determine if it is valid. Any estate   administration expenses, such as attorneys, accountants and appraisers fees,   must also be paid.</p>
<p>Step 5: Distribute the Assets. After all debts and expenses have been paid,   the distribute the assets with extra attention and meticulous bookkeeping by the   executor. Frequently, beneficiaries can receive partial distributions of their   inheritance without having to wait for the closing of the estate.</p>
<p>WHO SHOULD SERVE AS EXECUTOR? The executors legally imposed fiduciary duty is   to act in all ways in the best interests of the estate and its beneficiaries.   The duties of an executor can be difficult and challenging and should not be   taken lightly.</p>
<p>We believe an executor needs not only the skills, training, and experience   necessary to do the project--casual or part-time attention is not likely to   achieve success.</p>
<p>Under increasingly complex laws and rulings, particularly with respect to   taxes, an executor can be in charge for two or three years before the estate   administration is completed. If the job is to be done without unnecessary cost   and without causing undue hardship and delay for the beneficiaries of the   estate, the executor should have an understanding of the many problems involved   and an organization created for settling estates. In short, an executor should   have experience.</p>

<p>RULE 4:84. COMPLAINTS IN CASES IN WHICH SURROGATES COURT NOT ABLE TO ACT</p>

If an order is granted without notice, it shall give any person in   interest leave to move for the discharge of the administrator on no more than 2   days notice.

<p>RULE 4:85. REVIEW BY SUPERIOR COURT OF ACTIONS BY SURROGATES COURT: GENERAL   PROVISIONS</p>
<p>4:85-1. Complaint; Time for Filing</p>
<p>If a will has been probated by the Surrogates Court or letters testamentary   or of administration, guardianship or trusteeship have been issued, any person   aggrieved by that action may, upon the filing of a complaint setting forth the   basis for the relief sought, obtain an order requiring the personal   representative, guardian or trustee to show cause why the probate should not be   set aside or modified or the grant of letters of appointment vacated, provided,   however, the complaint is filed within four months after probate or of the grant   of letters of appointment, as the case may be, or if the aggrieved person   resided outside this State at the time of the grant of probate or grant of   letters, within six months thereafter. If relief, however, is sought based upon   R. 4:50-1(d), (e) or (f) or R. 4:50-3 (fraud upon the court) the complaint shall   be filed within a reasonable time under the circumstances. The complaint and   order to show cause shall be served as provided by R. 4:67-3. Other persons in   interest may, on their own motion, apply to intervene in the action.</p>
<p>4:85-2. Enlargement of Time</p>
<p>The time periods prescribed by R. 4:85-1 may be extended for a period not   exceeding 30 days by order of the court upon a showing of good cause and the   absence of prejudice.</p>
<p>4:85-3. After-Discovered Will</p>
<p>(a) Order to Show Cause. Where administration has been granted and   subsequently a will is offered for probate or where probate of a will has been   granted and subsequently a later will is offered for probate, the person   offering such will may, upon the filing of a complaint, move without notice for   an order requiring all interested persons to show cause why probate of such will   should not be granted. The complaint shall be filed in the county where the   original administration or probate was granted. If, on the return date or   thereafter, new probate is granted, the court shall require the administrator or   prior executor to make final settlement of his or her account and thereafter   shall make such order respecting commissions as is appropriate.</p>
<p>(b) Probate by Surrogate. If, on the return date of the order to show cause,   there is no objection to the offering of the after-discovered will for probate,   the Surrogate may enter an order that it be lodged for probate and thereafter   proceed with probate unless a caveat has been filed or doubt arises from the   face of the will.</p>
