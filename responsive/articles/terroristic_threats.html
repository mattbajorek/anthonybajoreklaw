<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC represents individuals charged with criminal and serious traffic violations   throughout New Jersey.</p>
<p>If someone is charged with Criminal terroristic threats, the judge will read   to the jurors the following Jury Instructions of the Law:</p>
<p>TERRORISTIC THREATS</p>
<p>(N.J.S.A. 2C:12-3(a)</p>
<p>The indictment charges the defendant with committing terroristic threats. The   pertinent part of our statute is as follows: (CHOOSE APPLICABLE ALTERNATIVE)</p>
<p>(1) &quot;A person is guilty of a crime if he threatens to commit any crime of   violence with the purpose to terrorize another or in reckless disregard of the   risk of causing such terror.&quot;</p>
<p>(2) &quot;A person commits a crime if he threatens to commit a crime of violence   with the purpose to cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly or   facility of public transportation or otherwise to cause serious public   inconvenience or in reckless disregard of the risk of causing such evacuation or   inconvenience.</p>
<p>The prosecution must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable   doubt:</p>
<p>1. The defendant made a threat, or threatened to commit a crime of violence   against (the victims name).</p>
<p>(CHOOSE APPLICABLE ALTERNATIVE)</p>
<p>2. That the threat to commit a crime of violence was with the purpose to   terrorize another or in reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror   or</p>
<p>3. That the threat to commit a crime of violence was to cause evacuation of a   building, place or assembly or facility of public transportation or otherwise to   cause serious public inconvenience or in reckless disregard of the risk of   causing such evacuation or inconvenience.</p>
<p>4. A person acts purposely with respect to the nature of (his/her) conduct or   a result thereof if it is (his/her) conscious object to engage in conduct of   that nature or to cause such a result.</p>
<p>A person acts purposely with respect to the attendant circumstance if the   person is aware of the existence of such circumstances or the person believes or   hopes that they exist. &quot;With purpose,&quot; &quot;design,&quot; &quot;with design,&quot; or equivalent   terms have the same meaning. A person acts recklessly with respect to the nature   of (his/her) conduct when the person consciously disregards a substantial and   unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from   (his/her) conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree, that   considering the nature and purpose of the actors conduct and the circumstances   known to the actor, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard   of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actors situation. In   other words, in order for you to find the defendant acted recklessly, the State   must first prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware of this   substantial and unjustifiable risk. In addition, the State must prove that the   defendant consciously disregarded this risk. For you to conclude that the   defendant acted recklessly, you must find that this disregard was a gross   deviation from the way a reasonable person would have conducted   (himself/herself) in the situation. The gist of the offense is that the words or   actions used by the defendant are of such a nature to convey the menace or fear   of a crime of violence to the ordinary hearer or individual. The crime of   violence is that the words or actions used by the defendant are of such a nature   to convey the menace or fear of a crime of violence to the ordinary hearer or   individual.</p>
<p>The crime of violence that is alleged by the prosecution that the defendant   threatened is (set forth and define appropriate crime of violence alleged).</p>
<p>It is not necessary that the victim was terrorized (or that there was   actually an evacuation of a building, place of assembly or facility of public   transportation.) It is not a violation of this statute if the threat expresses   only a fleeting anger or that the threat was merely with the intent to alarm. If   the State has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any one of the elements   that have been described to you, you must find the defendant not guilty. If the   State has proven all the elements beyond a reasonable doubt, then you should   find the defendant guilty.</p>
<p>2C:12-3. Terroristic threats a. A person is guilty of a crime of the third   degree if he threatens to commit any crime of violence with purpose to terrorize   another or to cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly, or facility of   public transportation, or otherwise to cause serious public inconvenience, or in   reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror or inconvenience.</p>
<p>b. A person is guilty of a crime of the third degree if he threatens to kill   another with purpose to put him in imminent fear of death under circumstances   reasonably causing the victim to believe the immediacy of the threat and the   likelihood that it will be carried out.</p>
