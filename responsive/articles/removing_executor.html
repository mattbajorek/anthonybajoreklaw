<h1 align="center"><strong>Removing an Executor from an Estate</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>by Kenneth A. Vercammen, Esq.</p>
<p>Under New Jersey Law, the people selected as an executor of a Will have   numerous legal responsibilities following the death of the person who signed the   Will. Primarily, they have a duty to probate the Will, liquidate assets, pay   bills and taxes, file all necessary court and tax returns, and then distribute   the assets to beneficiaries. If there is no will, someone can petition the   surrogate to be appointed as &quot;administrator&quot; of the estate.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, the court and surrogate do not supervise how an executor or   administrator handles the estate. Unfortunately, the Executor occasionally fails   to timely carry out their duties. They may fail to file tax returns, fail to   keep records, misappropriate funds or ignore instructions under the Will. If you   are not satisfied with the handling of the estate, you can have an attorney file   a Complaint in the Superior Court.</p>
<p>The New Probate Statute of NJ revised various sections of the New Jersey law   on Wills and estates. law makes a number of substantial changes to the   provisions governing the administration of estates and trusts in New.</p>
<p>Duty of Executor in Probate &amp; Estate Administration</p>
<p>1. Conduct a thorough search of the decedents personal papers and effects for   any evidence which might point you in the direction of a potential creditor;</p>
<p>2. Carefully examine the decedents checkbook and check register for recurring   payments, as these may indicate an existing debt;</p>
<p>3. Contact the issuer of each credit card that the decedent had in his/her   possession at the time of his/ her death;</p>
<p>4. Contact all parties who provided medical care, treatment, or assistance to   the decedent prior to his/her death;</p>
<p>Your attorney will not be able to file the NJ inheritance tax return until it   is clear as to the amounts of the medical bills and other expenses. Medical   expenses can be deducted in the inheritance tax.</p>

<p>Lets review the major duties involved-</p>
<p>In General. The executors job is to (1) administer the estate--i.e., collect   and manage assets, file tax returns and pay taxes and debts--and (2) distribute   any assets or make any distributions of bequests, whether personal or charitable   in nature, as the deceased directed (under the provisions of the Will). Lets   take a look at some of the specific steps involved and what these   responsibilities can mean. Chronological order of the various duties may   vary.</p>
<p>Probate. The executor must &quot;probate&quot; the Will. Probate is a process by which   a Will is admitted. This means that the Will is given legal effect by the court.   The courts decision that the Will was validly executed under state law gives the   executor the power to perform his or her duties under the provisions of the   Will.</p>
<p>An employer identification number (&quot;EIN&quot;) should be obtained for the estate;   this number must be included on all returns and other tax documents having to do   with the estate. The executor should also file a written notice with the IRS   that he/she is serving as the fiduciary of the estate. This gives the executor   the authority to deal with the IRS on the estates behalf.</p>
<p>Pay the Debts. The claims of the estates creditors must be paid. Sometimes a   claim must be litigated to determine if it is valid. Any estate administration   expenses, such as attorneys, accountants and appraisers fees, must also be   paid.</p>
<p>Manage the Estate. The executor takes legal title to the assets in the   probate estate. The probate court will sometimes require a public accounting of   the estate assets. The assets of the estate must be found and may have to be   collected. As part of the asset management function, the executor may have to   liquidate or run a business or manage a securities portfolio. To sell marketable   securities or real estate, the executor will have to obtain stock power, tax   waivers, file affidavits, and so on.</p>
<p>Take Care of Tax Matters. The executor is legally responsible for filing   necessary income and estate-tax returns (federal and state) and for paying all   death taxes (i.e., estate and inheritance). The executor can, in some cases be   held personally liable for unpaid taxes of the estate. Tax returns that will   need to be filed can include the estates income tax return (both federal and   state), the federal estate-tax return, the state death tax return (estate and/or   inheritance), and the deceaseds final income tax return (federal and state).   Taxes usually must be paid before other debts. In many instances, federal   estate-tax returns are not needed as the size of the estate will be under the   amount for which a federal estate-tax return is required.</p>
<p>Often it is necessary to hire an appraiser to value certain assets of the   estate, such as a business, pension, or real estate, since estate taxes are   based on the &quot;fair market&quot; value of the assets. After the filing of the returns   and payment of taxes, the Internal Revenue Service will generally send some type   of estate closing letter accepting the return. Occasionally, the return will be   audited.</p>
<p>Distribute the Assets. After all debts and expenses have been paid, the   executor will distribute the assets. Frequently, beneficiaries can receive   partial distributions of their inheritance without having to wait for the   closing of the estate.</p>
<p>Under increasingly complex laws and rulings, particularly with respect to   taxes, in larger estates an executor can be in charge for two or three years   before the estate administration is completed. If the job is to be done without   unnecessary cost and without causing undue hardship and delay for the   beneficiaries of the estate, the executor should have an understanding of the   many problems involved and an organization created for settling estates. In   short, an executor should have experience</p>
<p>At some point in time, you may be asked to serve as the executor of the   estate of a relative or friend, or you may ask someone to serve as your   executor. An executors job comes with many legal obligations. Under certain   circumstances, an executor can even be held personally liable for unpaid estate   taxes. Lets review the major duties involved, which weve set out below.</p>

Occasionally, the return will be   audited.</p>
<p>Distribute the Assets. After all debts and expenses have been paid, the   distribute the assets with extra attention and meticulous bookkeeping by the   executor. Frequently, beneficiaries can receive partial distributions of their   inheritance without having to wait for the closing of the estate.</p>
<p>Under increasingly complex laws and rulings, particularly with respect to   taxes, in larger estates an executor can be in charge for two or three years   before the estate administration is completed. If the job is to be done without   unnecessary cost and without causing undue hardship and delay for the   beneficiaries of the estate, the executor should have an understanding of the   many problems involved and an organization created for settling estates.</p>
<p>COMPLAINT FOR ACCOUNTING</p>
<p>A Complaint for Accounting is filed with the Probate Part to request on   accounting, removal of the current executor and selection of a new person to   administer and wrap up the estate.</p>
<p>A signed certification of one or more beneficiaries is needed. In addition,   an Order to Show Cause is prepared by your attorney. The Order to Show Cause is   to be signed by the Judge directing the executor, through their attorney, to   file a written answer to the complaint, as well as appear before the court at a   specific date and time.</p>
<p>As with a litigated court matter, trials can become expensive. Competent   elder law/probate attorney may charge an hourly rate of $225-$350 per hour, with   a retainer of $3000 needed. Attorneys will require the retainer to be paid in   full up front.</p>
<p>The plaintiff can demand the following:</p>
<p>(1) That the named executor be ordered to provide an accounting of the estate   to plaintiff.</p>
<p>(2) Defendant, be ordered to provide an accounting for all assets of d1 dated   five years prior to death.</p>
<p>(3) Payment of plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs of suit for the within   action.</p>
<p>(4) Declaring a constructive trust of the assets of the decedent for the   benefit of the plaintiff and the estate.</p>
<p>(5) That the executor be removed as the executor/administrator of the estate   and that p1 be named as administrator of the estate.</p>
<p>(6) That the executor be barred from spending any estate funds, be barred   from paying any bills, be barred from taking a commission, be barred from   writing checks, be barred from acting on behalf of the estate, except as   specifically authorized by Superior Court Order or written consent by the   plaintiff.</p>
<p>EXECUTORS COMMISSIONS</p>
<p>Executors are entitled to receive a commission to compensate them for work   performed. Under NJSA 3B:18-1 et seq., Executors, administrators and other   fiduciaries are entitled to receive a commission on both the principal of the   estate, and the income earned by assets.</p>
<p>However, if you have evidence that the executor has breached their fiduciary   duties or violated a law, your Superior Court accounting complaint can request   that the commissions be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p>SALE OF REAL ESTATE AND OTHER PROPERTY</p>
<p>Occasionally, a family member is living in a home owned by the decedent. To   keep family harmony, often this family member is permitted to remain in the home   temporarily. However, it may later become clear that the resident has no desire   on moving, and the executor has neither an intention to make them move nor to   sell the house. The remedy a beneficiary has can be to have your attorney   include in the Superior Court complaint a count to</p>
<p>1) remove the executor</p>
<p>2) remove the tenant and make them pay rent to the estate for the time they   used the real property since death without paying rent</p>
<p>3) compel the appraisal of the home and, thereafter, the sale of the   property</p>
<p>4) make the executor reimburse the estate for the neglect or waste of   assets.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>As a beneficiary, you will probably eventually be requested to sign a release   and refunding bond. If you have evidence of misappropriation, you may consider   asking the executor for an informal accounting prior to signing the release and   refunding bond. If you have concern regarding the handling of an estate,   schedule an appointment to consult an elder law attorney.</p>
