<h1 align="center"><strong>Living Wills</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>A living will is your written expression of how you want to be treated in   certain medical conditions. Depending on state law, this document may permit you   to express whether or not you wish to be given life-sustaining treatments in the   event you are terminally ill or injured, to decide in advance whether you wish   to be provided food and water via intravenous devices (&quot;tube feeding&quot;), and to   give other medical directions that impact the end of life. &quot;Life-sustaining   treatment&quot; means the use of available medical machinery and techniques, such as   heart-lung machines, ventilators, and other medical equipment and techniques   that will sustain and possibly extend your life, but which will not by   themselves cure your condition. In addition to terminal illness or injury   situations, most states permit you to express your preferences as to treatment   using life-sustaining equipment and/or tube feeding for medical conditions that   leave you permanently unconscious and without detectable brain activity.</p>
<p>A living will applies in situations where the decision to use such treatments   may prolong your life for a limited period of time and not obtaining such   treatment would result in your death. It does not mean that medical   professionals would deny you pain medications and other treatments that would   relieve pain or otherwise make you more comfortable. Living wills do not   determine your medical treatment in situations that do not affect your continued   life, such as routine medical treatment and non life-threatening medical   conditions. In all states the determination as to whether or not you are in such   a medical condition is determined by medical professionals, usually your   attending physician and at least one other medical doctor who has examined you   and/or reviewed your medical situation. Most states permit you to include other   medical directions that you wish your physicians to be aware of regarding the   types of treatment you do or do not wish to receive.</p>
<p>All States have declared that competent adults have the fundamental right in   collaboration with their health care providers, to control decisions about their   own health care. States recognize in their law and public policy, the personal   right of the individual patient to make voluntary, informed choices to accept,   to reject or to choose among alternative courses of medical and surgical   treatment.</p>
<p>WHY LIVING WILLS<br />
  Modern advances in science and medicine have made   possible the prolongation of the lives of many seriously ill individuals,   without always offering realistic prospects for improvement or cure. For some   individuals the possibility of extended life is experienced as meaningful and of   benefit. For others, artificial prolongation of life may seem to provide nothing   medically necessary or beneficial, serving only to extend suffering and prolong   the dying process. States recognize the inherent dignity and value of human life   and within this context recognize the fundamental right of individuals to make   health care decisions to have life-prolonging medical or surgical means or   procedures provided, withheld, or withdrawn.<br />
  States recognize the right of   competent adults to plan ahead for health care decisions through the execution   of advance directives, such as living wills and durable powers of attorney, and   to have their wishes respected, subject to certain limitations.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF LIVING WILLS<br />
  In order to assure respect for patients previously   expressed wishes when the capacity to participate actively in decision making   has been lost or impaired; to facilitate and encourage a sound decision making   process in which patients, health care representatives, families, physicians,   and other health care professionals are active participants; to properly   consider patients interests both in self-determination and in well-being; and to   provide necessary and appropriate safeguards concerning the termination of   life-sustaining treatment for incompetent patients as the law and public policy   of this State, the Legislatures have enacted Living Will/ Advance Directives for   Health Care Acts.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS OF STATUTE<br />
  The advance directive for health care (Living   Will) requires a writing executed in accordance with the requirements of the   state law. It must be either signed and dated in front of an attorney at law or   other person authorized to administer oaths, or in the presence of two   subscribing adult witnesses. If the two adult witnesses are used, they both must   attest that the declarant is of sound mind and not under undue influence. A   designated health care representative shall not act as a witness to the   execution of the advance directive. Since this is a legal document, it must be   executed properly to be valid under the statute.</p>
<p>HEALTH CARE REPRESENTATIVE<br />
  The declarant must designate one or more   alternative health care representatives. &quot;Health care representative&quot; means the   person designated by you under the Living Will for the purpose of making health   care decisions on your behalf.</p>
<p>WHEN DOES THE ADVANCE DIRECTIVE BECOME <br />
  OPERATIVE<br />
  An advance directive   becomes operative when (1) it is transmitted to the attending physician or to   the health care institution, and (2) it is determined pursuant to the Act that   the patient lacks capacity to make a particular health care   decision.<br />
  Treatment decisions pursuant to an advance directive shall not be   made and implemented until there has been a reasonable opportunity to establish   and where appropriate confirm, a reliable diagnosis for the patient which shall   include the attending physicians opinion concerning the nature, cause, extent,   and probable duration of the patients incapacity, and shall be made a part of   the patients medical records. For additional information or to have a &quot;Living   Will&quot; prepared, see your attorney. In addition, be certain your Last Will and   testament is up to date.<br />

  3. Terms You Should<br />
4.   Understand</p>
<p>1. Introduction:</p>
<p>As Americans, we take it for granted that we are entitled to make decisions   about our own health care. Most of the time we make these decisions after   talking with our own physician about the advantages and disadvantages of various   treatment options. The right of a competent individual to accept or refuse   medical treatment is a fundamental right now fully protected by law.</p>
<p>But what happens if serious illness, injury or permanent loss of mental   capacity makes us incapable of talking to a doctor and deciding what medical   treatments we do or do not want? These situations pose difficult questions to   all of us as patients, family members, friends and health care professionals.   Who makes these decisions if we cant make them for ourselves? If we cant make   our preferences known how can we make sure that our wishes will be respected? If   disagreements arise among those caring for us about different treatment   alternatives how will they be resolved? Is there a way to alleviate the burdens   shouldered by family members and loved ones when critical medical decisions must   be made?</p>
<p>Living Will:</p>
<p>By using documents known as advance directives for health care, you can   answer some of these questions and give yourself the security of knowing that   you can continue to have a say in your own treatment. A properly prepared Living   Will permits you to plan ahead so you can both make your wishes known, and   select someone who will see to it that your wishes are followed.</p>
<p>After all, if you are seriously ill or injured and cant make decisions for   yourself someone will have to decide about your medical care. Doesnt it make   sense to</p>
<p>•Have a person you trust make decisions for you,</p>
<p>•Provide instructions about the treatment you do and do not want, or</p>
<p>•Both appoint a person to make decisions and provide them with   instructions.</p>
<p>A Few Definitions<br />
  <br />
  Throughout this booklet there are four phrases. Each   of these phrases has a special meaning when it comes to allowing you to make   decisions about your future health care.</p>
<p>• Advance directive-If you want your wishes to guide those responsible for   your care you have to plan for what you want in advance. Generally such planning   is more likely to be effective if its done in writing. So, by an &quot;advance   directive&quot; we mean any written directions you prepare in advance to say what   kind of medical care you want in the event you become unable to make decisions   for yourself.</p>
<p><br />
  1. Proxy directives - One way to have a say in your future medical care   is to designate a person (a proxy) you trust and give that person the legal   authority to decide for you if you are unable to make decisions for yourself.   Your chosen proxy (known as a health care representative) serves as your   substitute, &quot;standing in&quot; for you in discussions with your physician and others   responsible for your care. So, by a proxy directive we mean written directions   that name a &quot;proxy&quot; to act for you. Another term some people use for a proxy   directive is a &quot;durable power of attorney for health care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. Instruction directives - Another way to have a say in your future medical   care is to provide those responsible for your care with a statement of your   medical treatment preferences. By &quot;instruction directive&quot; we mean written   directions that spell out in advance what medical treatments you wish to accept   or refuse and the circumstances in which you want your wishes implemented. These   instructions then serve as a guide to those responsible for your care. Another   term some people use for an instruction directive is a &quot;living will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3. Combined directives - A third way combines features of both the proxy and   the instruction directive. You may prefer to give both written instructions, and   to designate a health care representative or proxy to see that your instructions   are carried out.</p>
<p>2. Questions and Answers</p>
<p>1. Why should I consider writing an advance directive/ living will?</p>
<p>Serious injury, illness or mental incapacity may make it impossible for you   to make health care decisions for yourself. In these situations, those   responsible for your care will have to make decisions for you. Advance   directives are legal documents which provide information about your treatment   preferences to those caring for you, helping to insure that your wishes are   respected even when you cant make decisions yourself A clearly written and   legally prepared directive helps prevent disagreements among those close to you   and alleviates some of the burdens of decision making which are often   experienced by family members, friends and health care providers.</p>
<p>2. When does my advance directive take effect?</p>
<p>Your directive takes effect when you no longer have the ability to make   decisions about your health care. This judgment is normally made by your   attending physician, and any additional physicians who may be required by law to   examine you. If there is any doubt about your ability to make such decisions,   your doctor will consult with another doctor with training and experience in   this area Together they will decide if you are unable to make your own health   care decisions.</p>
<p>3. What happens if I regain the ability to make my own decisions?</p>
<p>If you regain your ability to make decisions, then you resume making your own   decisions directly. Your directive is in effect only as long as you are unable   to make your own decisions.</p>
<p>4. Are there particular treatments I should specifically mention in my   directive?</p>
<p>It is a good idea to indicate your specific preferences concerning two   specific kinds of life sustaining measures:</p>
<p>1. Artificially provided fluids and nutrition; and</p>
<p>2. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p>
<p>Stating your preferences clearly concerning these two treatments will be of   considerable help in avoiding uncertainty, disagreements or confusion about your   wishes. The enclosed forms provide a space for you to state specific directions   concerning your wishes with respect to these two forms of treatment.</p>
<p>Fluids and Nutrition. I request that artificially provided fluids and   nutrition, such as by feeding tube or intravenous infusion (initial one)</p>
<p>1. ______ shall be withheld or withdrawn as &quot;Life Sustaining   Treatment.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  2. ______ shall be provided to the extent medically   appropriate even if other &quot;Life Sustaining Treatment&quot; is withheld or   withdrawn.</p>
<p>Directive as to Medical Treatment. I request that &quot;Life Sustaining Treatment&quot;   be withheld or withdrawn from me in each of the following circumstances:   (Initial all that apply)</p>
<p>1. ______ If the &quot;life sustaining treatment&quot; is experimental and not a proven   therapy, or is likely to be ineffective or futile in prolonging my life, or is   likely to merely prolong an imminent dying process;<br />
  2. ______ If I am   permanently unconscious (total and irreversible loss of consciousness and   capacity for interaction with the environment);<br />
  3. ______ If I am in a   terminal condition (terminal stage of an irreversibly fatal illness, disease, or   condition); or<br />
  4. ______ If I have a serious irreversible illness or   condition, and the likely risks and burdens associated with the medical   intervention to be withheld or withdrawn outweigh the likely benefits to me from   such intervention.<br />
  5. ______ None of the above. I direct that all medically   appropriate measures be provided to sustain my life, regardless of my physical   or mental condition.</p>
<p>5. What is the advantage of having a health care representative, isnt it   enough to have an instruction directive?</p>
<p>Your doctor and other health care professionals are legally obligated to   consider your expressed wishes as stated in your instruction directive or   &quot;living will.&rdquo; However, instances may occur in which medical circumstances arise   or treatments are proposed that you may not have thought about when you wrote   your directive. If this happens your health care representative has the   authority to participate in discussions with your health care providers and to   make treatment decisions for you in accordance with what he or she knows of your   wishes. Your health care representative will also be able to make decisions as   your medical condition changes, in accordance with your wishes and best   interests.</p>
<p>6. If I decide to appoint a health care representative, who should I trust   with this task?</p>
<p>The person you choose to be your health care representative has the legal   right to accept or refuse medical treatment (including life-sustaining measures)   on your behalf and to assure that your wishes concerning your medical treatment   are carried out. You should choose a person who knows you well, and who is   familiar with your feelings about different types of medical treatment and the   conditions under which you would choose to accept or refuse either a specific   treatment or all treatment.</p>
<p>A health care representative must understand that his or her responsibility   is to implement your wishes even if your representative or others might disagree   with them. So it is important to select someone in whose judgment you have   confidence. People that you might consider asking to be your health care   representative include:</p>
<p>• a member of your family or a very close friend, your priest, rabbi, or   minister, or <br />
  • a trusted health care provider, but your attending physician   cannot serve as both your physician and your health care representative.</p>
<p>7. Should I discuss my wishes with my health care representative and   others?</p>
<p>Absolutely! Your health care representative is the person who speaks for you   when you cant speak for yourself. It is very important that he or she has a   clear sense of your feelings, attitudes and health care preferences. You should   also discuss your wishes with your physician, family members and others who will   be involved in caring for you.</p>
<p>8. Does my health care representative have the authority to make all health   care decisions for me?</p>
<p>It is up to you to say what your health care representative can and cannot   decide. You may wish to give him or her broad authority to make all treatment   decisions including decisions to forego life-sustaining measures. On the other   hand, you may wish to restrict the authority to specific treatments or   circumstances. Your representative has to respect these limitations.</p>
<p>9. Is my doctor obligated to talk to my health care representative?</p>
<p>Yes. Your health care representative has the legal authority to make medical   decisions on your behalf, in consultation with your doctor. Your doctor is   legally obligated to consult with your chosen representative and to respect his   or her decision as if it were your decision.</p>
<p><br />
  10. Is my health care representative the only person who can speak for   me, or can other friends or family members participate in making treatment   decisions?</p>
<p>It is generally a good idea for your health care representative to consult   with family members or others in making decisions, and if you wish you can   direct that he or she do so. It should be understood by everyone, however, that   your health care representative is the only person with the legal authority to   make decisions about your health care even if others disagree.</p>
<p>11. Can I request all measures be taken to sustain my life?</p>
<p>Yes. You should make this choice clear in your advance directive. Remember, a   directive can be used to request medical treatments as well as to refuse   unwanted ones.</p>
<p>12. Does my doctor have to carry out my wishes as stated in my instruction   directive?</p>
<p>If your treatment preferences are clear your doctor is legally obligated to   implement your wishes. unless doing this would violate his or her conscience or   accepted medical practice. If your doctor is unwilling to honor your wishes he   or she must assist in transferring you to the care of another doctor.</p>
<p>13. Can I make changes in my directive?</p>
<p>Yes. An advance directive can be updated or modified in whole or in part, at   any time, by a legally competent individual. You should update your directive   whenever you feel it no longer accurately reflects your wishes. It is a good   idea to review your directive on a regular basis, perhaps every 5 years. Each   time you review the directive, indicate the date on the form itself and have   someone witness the changes you make. If you make a lot of changes, you may want   to write a new directive. Remember to notify all those important to you of any   changes you make.</p>
<p>14. Can I revoke my directive at any time?</p>
<p>Yes. You can revoke your directive at any time, regardless of your physical   or mental condition. This can be done in writing, orally, or by any action which   indicates that you no longer want the directive to be in effect.</p>
<p>15. Who should have copies of my advance directive?</p>
<p>A copy should be given to the person that you have named as your health care   representative, as well as to your family, your doctor, and others who are   important to you. If you enter a hospital, nursing home, or hospice, a copy of   your advance directive should be provided so that it can be made part of your   medical records. The back cover of this brochure contains a wallet size card you   can complete and carry with you to tell others that you have an advance   directive.</p>
<p>16. Can I use my advance directive to make an organ donation upon my   death?</p>
<p>Yes. You may state your wishes regarding organ donation. Also you may want to   place an organ donor card in your wallet to alert medical personnel. Any card   will do. If you decide to make a gift of your organs upon your death please   complete the card and carry it with you at all times. For further information   regarding organ donation you should contact either an organ procurement agency   or your local hospital.</p>
<p><br />
  3. Terms You Should Understand</p>
<p>1. Artificially provided fluids and nutrition: <br />
  The provision of food and   water to seriously ill patients who are unable or unwilling to eat. Depending on   the method used, such as insertion of a feeding tube or an intravenous line, and   the condition of the patient, techniques may involve minor surgery, continuous   supervision by medical (and sometimes surgical) personnel, risk of injury or   infection, and side effects.</p>
<p>2. C a r d i o p u l m o n a r y Resuscitation (CPR): <br />
  A treatment   administered by health care professionals when a persons heartbeat and breathing   stops. CPR may restore functioning if administered properly and in a timely   fashion and may include the use of mechanical devices and/or drugs.</p>
<p>3. Life-sustaining measures: <br />
  Any medical procedure, device, artificially   provided fluids and nutrition, drugs, surgery, or therapy that uses mechanical   or other artificial means to sustain, restore or supplant a vital bodily   function. thereby prolonging the life of a patient.</p>
<p>4. Decision making capacity: <br />
  A patients ability to understand the   benefits and risks of a proposed medical treatment and its alternatives and to   reach an informed decision.</p>
<p>5. Health care representative or health care proxy: <br />
  In the event an   individual loses decision making capacity, a health care representative or proxy   is a person who has been legally designated to make decisions on his or her   behalf. A health care representative is appointed through the execution of a   proxy directive (a durable power of attorney for health care).</p>
<p>6. Terminal condition : <br />
  The terminal stage of an irreversibly fatal   illness, disease, or condition. While determination of a specific &quot;life   expectancy&quot; is not required for a diagnosis of a &quot;terminal condition a prognosis   of a life expectancy of one year or less, with or without the provision of   life-sustaining treatment, is generally considered terminal.</p>
<p>7. P e r m a n e n t unconsciousness: <br />
  A medical condition defined as   total and irreversible loss of consciousness. The term &quot;permanently unconscious&quot;   includes the conditions persistent vegetative state and irreversible coma   Patients in this condition cannot interact with their surroundings or others in   any way and do not experience pleasure or pain.</p>
<p>8. Persistent vegetative state: <br />
  A condition of permanent unconsciousness   in which the patient loses all capacity for interaction with their environment   or other people. It is usually caused by an injury to the brain. It is normally   not regarded as a terminal condition and with the aid of medical care and   artificial fluids and nutrition patients can survive for many years.</p>
<p>9. Incurable and irreversible chronic diseases: <br />
  Disabling diseases such   as Alzheimers disease, organic brain syndrome or other diseases which get   progressively worse over time, eventually resulting in death. Depending on the   disease, the patient may also experience partial or complete loss of physical   and mental abilities. Because the rate at which these diseases advance may be   slow, such diseases are not considered terminal in their early   stages.<br />
  <br />
  10. Whole brain death: <br />
  Death due to total and irreversible   loss of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem. The   criteria of whole brain death must be used to accurately determine death in   individuals who have suffered massive or total brain damage but whose heart and   lungs are kept functioning by machines. Brain dead individuals are not   vegetative or in a coma. but are, in fact, dead.</p>
<p>11. Attending physician : <br />
  The doctor directly responsible for your   medical treatment. He or she may or may not be your regular family physician.   Depending on your health care needs the attending physician may consult with   others in order to diagnose and treat your medical condition, but he or she   remains directly responsible for your care.</p>
