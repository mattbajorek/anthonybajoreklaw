<p>Wills, Children &amp; Guardians</p>
<p>There may come a time when a parent is unable, due to physical or mental   incapacity, to take care of their minor children. In these circumstances, those   caring for the children as well as the courts will need direction.</p>
<p>By writing and executing a Will which includes instructions on guardianship   one may select someone, either individually or jointly, with the legal authority   to act for minor children and assume control over the assets of the children.   Estate planning, which includes the execution of a Will, is just as important   for young families with minor children as they are for senior citizens.</p>
<p>As average Americans, we work 80,000 hours in a lifetime, or 45 to 55 years.   In spite of all our resources and the assets we earn during our lifetime, the   vast majority of Americans do not take the time to create the legal instructions   to guide the court or a guardian. National statistics indicate that more than   50% of Americans die without leaving a will. In the absence of a will or other   legal arrangement to distribute property at death, the State must step in to   administer the estate and decide who gets custody of your children and handle   their money.</p>
<p>This process is called the law of intestacy. The result can be lengthy delays   in the distribution of your estate, court battles between relatives and your   children being raised by someone you do not favor. Without a Will, your family   will have to pay substantial costs for accountants, attorneys, bonding companies   and probate fees.</p>
<p>IF YOU HAVE NO WILL (LEGALLY REFERRED TO AS &quot;INTESTATE SECESSION&quot;):</p>
<p>If you leave no Will or your Will is declared invalid because it was   improperly prepared or is not admissible to probate:</p>
<p>* State law determines who gets assets, not you * Additional expenses will be   incurred by your heirs and extra work will be required by the heirs of their   attorney to qualify an administrator * The Judge determines who gets custody of   your children * Possible additional State inheritance taxes and Federal estate   taxes * If you have no spouse or relatives, the State may take your property *   The procedure to distribute assets becomes more complicated-and the law makes no   exceptions for persons in unusual need or for your own wishes. * It may also   cause fights and lawsuits within your family</p>
<p>When loved ones are grieving and dealing with death, they shouldnt be   overwhelmed with Financial concerns. Careful estate planning helps take care of   that.</p>
<p>Guardians</p>
<p>Most individuals appoint their spouse to act as Guardian of the person and   property of their minor children. It is suggested that your Will include a   clause which provides that in the event your spouse predeceases you, or is   unsuitable or ceases to act as Guardian of the person and property of your minor   children, you appoint a trusted family member or close friend to act as   successor Guardian of the person and property of your minor children.</p>
<p>Trustee</p>
<p>Select a trusted person, a close relative or friends, who will invest and   hold your childrens money. In your Will you can instruct the Trustee to apply   amounts of income and principal as they, in their sole discretion, deem proper   for the health, maintenance, education, welfare, or support of your children or   other minors. Direct that the trustee shall accumulate any income not needed for   the above purposes, paying and transferring the portion held in trust to the   beneficiary upon his or her attaining the age of majority or whichever age you   select.</p>
<p>Children born after you sign the Will</p>
<p>Many people direct that the provisions of their Will also applies to   afterborn children. Accordingly, if you have any additional children subsequent   to the execution of this Will, then wherever you have designated only your named   children, you intend that all of your children shall share equally in the   relevant provisions of your Will.</p>
<p>In addition to having a formal Last Will and Testament individuals are   encouraged to have a Power of Attorney and also Living Will. Moreover, we also   recommend they plan ahead and write messages to their family and anticipated   executor detailing their specific desires regarding funeral and burial. Written   instructions to your family and executor containing information and guidance   will minimize uncertainty, confusion, and possible oversights following your   death.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While the preceding article contains possible items to be discussed with your   family, attorney and executor, the article is by no means exhaustive. A number   of these items may not be applicable in your situation, and probably there are   many others that are applicable. The essential element is to spend some time now   considering what you should tell those most closely associated with you to   facilitate their handling of your affairs upon your death.</p>
