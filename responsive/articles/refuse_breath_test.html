<p>39:4-50.4a. Revocation for refusal to submit to breath test; penalties 2. a.   Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, the municipal court shall   revoke the right to operate a motor vehicle of any operator who, after being   arrested for a violation of R.S.39:4-50, shall refuse to submit to a test   provided for in section 2 of P.L.1966, c.142 (C.39:4-50.2) when requested to do   so, for six months unless the refusal was in connection with a second offense   under this section, in which case the revocation period shall be for two years   or unless the refusal was in connection with a third or subsequent offense under   this section in which case the revocation shall be for ten years. A conviction   or administrative determination of a violation of a law of a substantially   similar nature in another jurisdiction, regardless of whether that jurisdiction   is a signatory to the Interstate Driver License Compact pursuant to P.L.1966,   c.73 (C.39:5D-1 et seq.), shall constitute a prior conviction under this   section.</p>
<p>The municipal court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence   whether the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that the person had   been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on the public   highways or quasi-public areas of this State while the person was under the   influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic, hallucinogenic, or   habit-producing drug or marijuana; whether the person was placed under arrest,   if appropriate, and whether he refused to submit to the test upon request of the   officer; and if these elements of the violation are not established, no   conviction shall issue. In addition to any other requirements provided by law, a   person whose operators license is revoked for refusing to submit to a test shall   be referred to an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center established by subsection   (f.) of R.S.39:4-50 and shall satisfy the same requirements of the center for   refusal to submit to a test as provided for in section 2 of P.L.1966, c.142   (C.39:4-50.2) in connection with a first, second, third or subsequent offense   under this section that must be satisfied by a person convicted of a   commensurate violation of this section, or be subject to the same penalties as   such a person for failure to do so. The revocation shall be independent of any   revocation imposed by virtue of a conviction under the provisions of   R.S.39:4-50. In addition to issuing a revocation, except as provided in   subsection b. of this section, the municipal court shall fine a person convicted   under this section, a fine of not less than $250.00 nor more than $500.00.</p>
<p>b.The fine imposed upon the convicted person shall be not less than $500 or   more than $1,000 and the period of license suspension shall be one year for a   first offense, four years for a second offense and 20 years for a third or   subsequent offense, which period shall commence upon the completion of any   prison sentence imposed upon that person when a violation of this section occurs   while:</p>
<p>(1) on any school property used for school purposes which is owned by or   leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board, or within 1,000   feet of such school property;</p>
<p>(2) driving through a school crossing as defined in R.S.39:1-1 if the   municipality, by ordinance or resolution, has designated the school crossing as   such; or</p>
<p>(3) driving through a school crossing as defined in R.S.39:1-1 knowing that   juveniles are present if the municipality has not designated the school crossing   as such by ordinance or resolution.</p>
<p>A map or true copy of a map depicting the location and boundaries of the area   on or within 1,000 feet of any property used for school purposes which is owned   by or leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board produced   pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1997, c.101 (C.2C:35-7) may be used in a   prosecution under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p>It shall not be relevant to the imposition of sentence pursuant to paragraph   (1) or (2) of this subsection that the defendant was unaware that the prohibited   conduct took place while on or within 1,000 feet of any school property or while   driving through a school crossing. Nor shall it be relevant to the imposition of   sentence that no juveniles were present on the school property or crossing zone   at the time of the offense or that the school was not in session.</p>
