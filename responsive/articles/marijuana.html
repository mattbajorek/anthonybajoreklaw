<h1 align="center"><strong>2C:35-10 Marijuana</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC represents individuals charged with criminal and serious traffic violations   throughout New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Municipal Courts of New Jersey have jurisdiction to hear the following   drug-related offenses:</p>
<p>NJSA 2C:5-10(a)(4), possession of 50g or less of marijuana or 5g or less of   hashish;<br />
  NJSA 2C:35-10(b), using or being under the influence of CDS;<br />
  NJSA   2C:35-10(c), failure to deliver CDS to police;<br />
  NJSA 2C:36-2, possession of   drug paraphernalia</p>
<p>Violation of these statutes constitute disorderly person offenses. If   convicted, the court may impose a $500.00 Drug Enforcement Reduction penalty and   a $50.00 lab fee for each CDS charge. The court has discretion to fine a   defendant up to $1,000 and/or incarceration for up to six months. The $50.00   VCCB penalty also must be imposed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the court must suspend the defendant's driver's license for a time   period between six months and two years. In addition, probation for up to two   years, drug counseling, periodic urine testing, alcohol and/or psychiatric   counseling and community service may be imposed.</p>
<p>If you elect to initially plead not guilty, your attorney will send a   discovery letter/letter of representation to both the Municipal Prosecutor and   the Municipal Court Clerk. If you have a drug problem, it is recommended that   you attend a substance abuse treatment programs to seek help for any addiction.   Proof of attendance of such a program is of benefit at sentencing or in   obtaining an application for conditional discharge.</p>
<p>CONDITIONAL DISCHARGE</p>
<p>New Jersey State statute N.J.S.A. 2C: 36A-1 provides that a person not   previously convicted of a drug offense and who has not previously been granted   supervisory treatment under 24:21-27, 2C:43-12 or 2C: 36A-l may apply for a   conditional discharge. The court upon notice to the prosecutor and subject to   2C: 36A-l(c) may on the motion of the defendant or the court, suspend further   proceedings and place the defendant on supervisory treatment (i.e., probation,   supervised or unsupervised attendance at Narcotics Anonymous, etc.).</p>
<p>Since the granting of a conditional discharge is optional to the court, you   should be prepared to prove, through letters, documents, or even witnesses, that   the defendant's continued presence in the community or in a civil treatment   program, will not pose a danger to the community.</p>
<p>You should be prepared to convince the court that the terms and conditions of   supervisory treatment will be adequate to protect the public and will benefit   the defendant by serving to correct any dependence on or use of controlled   substances. The defendant must be required to pay a $45.00 application fee, plus   the mandatory $500.00 DEDR penalty, and $50.00 lab fee. The court further has   the option to suspend a defendant's driver's license between six months and two   years.</p>
<p>The conditional discharge period is also between six months and two years. If   the defendant is convicted of a drug offense during the CD period or violates   the conditions set by the court, the prosecution resumes. The defendant may even   apply for a conditional discharge after he/she is found guilty, but before   sentence is imposed. If the CD is granted at this point in the proceeding, the 6   to 24 month license suspension is mandatory.</p>
<p>SUPPRESSION MOTION</p>
<p>A timely Motion to Suppress Evidence must be made pursuant to Rule 3:5-7. The   court rules have been amended to provide the Suppression Motion can be held   directly in the Municipal Court. Your attorney can subpoena witnesses, sometimes   even serving a subpoena duces tecum on the arresting officer to compel him to   bring to court the object allegedly observed in plain view. Credibility will be   tested when the object that was claimed to be in plain view inside a car is   actually only one-half inch long. Cross-examination is very important.</p>
<p>PRE-TRIAL</p>
<p>The Municipal Court prosecutor is responsible for providing discovery. Rules   3:13-3, 7:4-2, State v Polasky, N.J. Super. 549 (Law Div. 1986); State v Tull,   234 N.J. Super. 486 (Law Div. 1989); State v Ford, 240 N.J. Super. 44 (App. Div.   1990). The State must prove the substance seized was a controlled dangerous   substance (CDS).</p>
<p>To prove the substance is CDS, either the lab technician who examined the   substance must be called testify, or the State will have to admit the lab   certificate prepared pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:35-19. If the State intends to   introduce the lab certificate at the trial, a notice of an intent to proffer   that certificate and all reports relating to the analysis of the CDS shall be   served on defense counsel at least 20 days before the proceeding begins. This   includes an actual copy of the lab certificate.</p>
<p>Within 10 days of receipt, the Defense counsel must notify the Prosecutor in   writing. This will not only alert the Prosecutor to the Defendant's objections   concerning the admission of the lab certificate into evidence, but also set   forth grounds for the objection, 2C:35-19c. Failure by defense counsel to timely   object shall constitute a waiver of any objection to the certificate, thus, the   certificate will be submitted into evidence.</p>
<p>THE TRIAL</p>
<p>The burden of primary possession/constructive possession remains on the   State. Plea bargaining is not permitted in Municipal Court CDS cases (while it   is available in such varied charges as murder, careless driving, or the burning   of old tires). The State must prove knowledge or purpose on the part of the   defendant.</p>
<p>Knowledge means that the defendant was aware of the existence of the object   and was aware of its character. Purpose means it was defendant's conscious   intention to obtain or possess the item while being aware of its character.   Knowledge of the character of the substance may be inferred from the   circumstances. 33 N.J. Practice Criminal Law &amp; Procedure (Miller) Sec. 378   p. 563 (2nd Ed 1990).</p>
<p>If actual possession cannot be demonstrated, defendant's constructive   possession may sometimes be shown by proof that the narcotics were subject to   dominion and control. If two or more persons share actual or constructive   possession, then their possession is joint. However, mere presence on premises   where CDS is found is not sufficient, in itself, to justify an inference that a   particular defendant was in sole or joint possession of the substance. State v   McMenamin 133 N.J. Super. 521,S24 (App. Div. 1975).</p>
<p>In State v. Shipp, 216 N.J. Super. 662,666 (App. Div. 1987), it was held that   there was insufficient evidence that the defendant, a passenger in the front   seat, had constructive possession of CDS secretly contained in envelopes in a   vinyl bag resting on the back seat next to another passenger in the car.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing if the item seized is a CDS through either a lab   report or the State Police chemist, the State must establish the chain of   custody. The prosecutor's witness will call witnesses to prove the location of   the seized drugs from the moment of initial seizure to the time of the testing   of the illegal drug.</p>
<p>If the state will be attempting to introduce a confession or other   incriminating statements, defense counsel may request on evidence rule 8 hearing   to determine if the requirements of Miranda v. Arizona 384 US. 436 (1966) have   been violated. If the defendant elects to take the stand, defense counsel must   be certain that he testifies with complete candor and does not try to embellish   his protestations of innocence.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Drug related offenses carry substantial penalties which will effect a person   for the rest of his life. The space limits of this article do not allow detailed   explanation of the extensive caselaw on controlled dangerous substances. Do not   permit drug use and you will not have to worry about the substantial   penalties.</p>
