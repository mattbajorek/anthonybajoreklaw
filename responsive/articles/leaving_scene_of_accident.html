  <img border="0" alt="" src="http://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/sd42images/tab.gif" />39:4-130. The driver of a   vehicle or street car involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of   any person, or damage to property of any one person in excess of $500.00 shall   by the quickest means of communication give notice of such accident to the local   police department or to the nearest office of the county police of the county or   of the State Police, and in addition shall within 10 days after such accident   forward a written report of such accident to the commission on forms furnished   by it. Such written reports shall contain sufficiently detailed information with   reference to a motor vehicle accident, including the cause, the conditions then   existing, the persons and vehicles involved and such information as may be   necessary to enable the chief administrator to determine whether the   requirements for the deposit of security required by law are inapplicable by   reason of the existence of insurance or other circumstances.  The chief   administrator may rely upon the accuracy of the information contained in any   such report, unless he has reason to believe that the report is erroneous.  The   commission may require operators involved in accidents to file supplemental   reports of accidents upon forms furnished by it when in the opinion of the   commission, the original report is insufficient.  The reports shall be without   prejudice, shall be for the information of the commission, and shall not be open   to public inspection.  The fact that the reports have been so made shall be   admissible in evidence solely to prove a compliance with this section, but no   report or any part thereof or statement contained therein shall be admissible in   evidence for any other purpose in any proceeding or action arising out of the   accident.<br />

  <br />
  <img border="0" alt="" src="http://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/sd42images/tab.gif" />Whenever the driver is   physically incapable of making a written report of an accident as required by   this section and such driver is not the owner of the vehicle, then the owner of   the vehicle involved in such accident shall make such report not made by the   driver.<br />
  <br />
  <img border="0" alt="" src="http://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/sd42images/tab.gif" />In those cases where a   driver knowingly violates the provisions of this section by failing to make a   written report of an accident, there shall be a permissive inference that the   registered owner of the vehicle which was involved in that accident was the   person involved in the accident; provided, however, if that vehicle is owned by   a rental car company or is a leased vehicle, there shall be a permissive   inference that the renter or authorized driver pursuant to a rental car contract   or the lessee, and not the owner of the vehicle, was the person involved in the   accident, and the requirements and penalties imposed pursuant to this section   shall be applicable to that renter or authorized driver or lessee and not the   owner of the vehicle.<br />

  <br />

  <img border="0" alt="" src="http://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/sd42images/tab.gif" />The chief administrator   may revoke or suspend the operators license privilege and registration privilege   of a person who violates this section.<br />
  <br />
<img border="0" alt="" src="http://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/sd42images/tab.gif" />For purposes of this   section, it shall not be a defense that the operator of the motor vehicle was   unaware of the existence or extent of personal injury or property damage caused   by the accident as long as the operator was aware that he was involved in an   accident.</p>
