Don't give up! Our Law Office can provide   experienced attorney representation if you are injured in an accident and suffer   a Serious Injury.</p>
<p>Sometimes, store customers are injured in fall downs caused by wet and   slippery floors or failure by stores to clean up broken or fallen items. No one   plans on being injured in an accident, whether it is a car accident, fall down   or other situation. Speak with a personal injury attorney immediately to retain   all your rights. The stores are responsible for the maintenance of their   premises which are used by the public. It is the duty of the store to inspect   and keep their premises in a safe condition and free from any and all pitfalls,   obstacles or traps that would likely cause injury to persons lawfully   thereon.</p>
<p>It is further the duty of the store to properly and adequately inspect,   maintain and keep the premises free from danger to life, limb and   property of persons lawfully and rightfully using same and to warn of any such   dangers or hazards thereon. You may be lawfully upon the premises as a business   invitee in the exercise of due care on your part, and solely by reason of the   omission, failure and default of the store, be caused to fall down. If the store   did not perform their duty to plaintiff to maintain the premises in a safe,   suitable and proper condition, you may be entitled to make a claim. If severely   injured, you can file a claim for damages, together with interest and costs of   suit. Injured people can demand trial by jury.</p>
<p>The following information is taken from the old model jury charges dealing   with fall downs by store customers:</p>
<p>INVITEE - DEFINED AND GENERAL DUTY OWED</p>
<p>An invitee is one who is permitted to enter or remain on land (or premises)   for a purpose of the owner (or occupier). He/she enters by invitation, expressed   or implied. The owner (or occupier) of the land (or premises) who by invitation,   expressed or implied, induced persons to come upon his/her premises, is under a   duty to exercise ordinary care to render the premises reasonably safe for the   purposes embraced in the invitation. Thus, he/she must exercise reasonable care   for the invitees safety. He/she must take such steps as are reasonable and   prudent to correct or give warning of hazardous conditions or defects actually   known to him/her (or his/her employees), and of hazardous conditions or defects   which he/she (or his/her employees) by the exercise of reasonable care, could   discover.</p>
<p>BUSINESS INVITEE FALL DOWNS:</p>
<p>The basic duty of a proprietor of premises to which the public is invited for   business purposes of the proprietor is to exercise reasonable care to see that   one who enters his/her premises upon that invitation has a reasonably safe place   to do that which is within the scope of the invitation.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>(1) Business Invitee: The duty owed to a business invitee is no different   than the duty owed to other invitees.</p>
<p>(2) Construction Defects, Intrinsic and Foreign Substances: The rules dealt   with in this section and subsequent sections apply mainly to those cases where   injury is caused by transitory conditions, such as falls due to foreign   substances or defects resulting from wear and tear or other deterioration of   premises which were originally constructed properly.</p>
<p>Where a hazardous condition is due to defective construction or construction   not in accord with applicable standards it is not necessary to prove that the   owner or occupier had actual knowledge of the defect or would have become aware   of the defect had he/she personally made an inspection. In such cases the owner   is liable for failing to provide a safe place for the use of the invitee.</p>
<p>Thus, in Brody v. Albert Lipson &amp; Sons, 17 N.J. 383 (1955), the court   distinguished between a risk due to the intrinsic quality of the material used   (calling it an intrinsic substance case) and a risk due to a foreign substance   or extra-normal condition of the premises. There the case was submitted to the   jury on the theory that the terrazzo floor was peculiarly liable to become   slipperier when wet by water and that defendant should have taken precautions   against such risk. The court appears to reject defendants contention that there   be notice, direct or inputed by proof of adequate opportunity to discover the   defective condition. 17 N.J. at 389.</p>
<p>It may be possible to reconcile this position with the requirement of   constructive notice of an unsafe condition by saying that an owner of premises   is chargeable with knowledge of such hazards in construction as a reasonable   inspection by an appropriate expert would reveal. See: Restatement to Torts 2d,   Â§343, Comment f, pp. 217-218 (1965), saying that a proprietor is required to   have superior knowledge of the dangers incident to facilities furnished to   invitees.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can view these cases as within the category of defective   or hazardous conditions created by defendant or by an independent contractor for   which defendant would be liable (see introductory note above).</p>
<p>Cases:</p>
<p>Bozza v. Vornado, Inc., 42 N.J. 355, 359 (1954) (slip and fall on sticky,   slimy substance in self-service cafeteria which inferably fell to the floor as   an incident of defendants mode of operation).</p>
<p>Buchner v. Erie Railroad Co., 17 N.J. 283, 285-286 (1955) (trip over   curbstone improperly illuminated).</p>
<p>Brody v. Albert Lifson &amp; Sons, 17 N.J. 383, 389 (1955) (slip and fall on   wet composition floor in store).</p>
<p>Bohn v. Hudson &amp; Manhattan R. Co., 16 N.J. 180, 185 (1954) (slip on   smooth stairway in railroad station).</p>
<p>Williams v. Morristown Memorial Hospital, 59 N.J. Super. 384, 389 (App. Div.   1960) (fall over low wire fence separating grass plot from sidewalk).</p>
<p>Nary v. Dover Parking Authority, 58 N.J. super. 222, 226-227 (App. Div.1959) (fall over bumper block in parking lot).</p>
<p>Parmenter v. Jarvis Drug Store, Inc., 48 N.J. Super. 507, 510 (App. Div.   1957) (slip and fall on wet linoleum near entrance of store on rainy day).</p>
<p>Nelson v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 48 N.J. Super. 300 (App. Div.   1958) (inadequate lighting of parking lot of supermarket, fall over unknown   object).</p>
<p>Barnard v. Trenton-New Brunswick Theatre Co., 32 N.J. Super. 551, 557 (App.   Div. 1954) (fall over ladder placed in theatre lobby by workmen of independent   contractor).</p>
<p>Ratering v. Mele, 11 N.J. Super. 211, 213 (App. Div. 1951) (slip and fall on   littered stairway at entrance to restaurant).</p>
<p>DUTY TO INSPECT OWED TO INVITEE. The duty of an owner (or occupier) of land   (or premises) to make the place reasonably safe for the proper use of an invitee   requires the owner or occupier to make reasonable inspection of the land (or   premises) to discover hazardous conditions.</p>
<p>Cases:</p>
<p>Handelman v. Cox, 39 N.J. 95, 111 (1963) (salesman showing merchandise to   employees of defendant fell down cellar stairway partially obscured by   carton)</p>
<p>NOTICE OF PARTICULAR DANGER AS CONDITION OF LIABILITY. If the jury members   find that the land (or premises) was not in a reasonably safe condition, then,   in order to recover, plaintiff must show either that the owner (or occupier)   knew of the unsafe condition for a period of time prior to plaintiffs injury   sufficient to permit him/her in the exercise of reasonable care to have   corrected it, or that the condition had existed for a sufficient length of time   prior to plaintiffs injury that in the exercise of reasonable care the owner (or   occupier) should have discovered its existence and corrected it.</p>
<p>Cases:</p>
<p>Tua v. Modern Homes, Inc., 64 N.J. Super. 211 (App. Div. 1960), affirmed, 33   N.J. 476 (1960) (slip and fall on small area of slipperier waxlike substance in   store); Parmenter v. Jarvis Drug Store, Inc., 48 N.J. Super. 507, 510 (App. Div.   1957) (slip and fall on wet linoleum near entrance of store on rainy day);   Ratering v. Mele, 11 N.J. Super. 211, 213 (App. Div. 1951) (slip and fall on   littered stairway at entrance to restaurant).</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>(1) The above charge is applicable to those cases where the defendant is not   at fault for the creation of the hazard of where the hazard is not to be   reasonably anticipated as an incident of defendants mode of operation. See:   Maugeri v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, 357 F.2d 202 (3rd Cir.   1966) (dictum).</p>
<p>(2) An employees knowledge of the danger is imputed to his/her employer, the   owner of premises. Handelman v. Cox, 39 N.J. 95, 104 (1963).</p>
<p>NOTICE NOT REQUIRED WHEN CONDITION IS CAUSED BY DEFENDANT</p>
<p>If the jury members find that the land (or premises) was not in a reasonably   safe condition and that the owner (or occupier) or his/her agent, servant or   employee created that condition through his/her own act or omission, then, in   order for plaintiff to recover, it is not necessary for the jury members also to   find that the owner (or occupier) had actual or constructive notice of the   particular unsafe condition.</p>
<p>Cases:</p>
<p>Smith v. First National Stores, 94 N.J. Super. 462 (App. Div. 1967)(slip and   fall on greasy stairway caused by sawdust tracked onto the steps by defendants   employees); Plaga v. Foltis, 88 N.J. Super. 209 (App. Div. 1965) (slip and fall   on fat in restaurant area traversed by bus boy); Torda v. Grand Union Co., 59   N.J. Super. 41 (App. Div. 1959) (slip and fall in self-service market on wet   floor near vegetable bin). Also see: Thompson v. Giant Tiger Corp., 118 N.J.L.   10 (E. &amp; A. 1937); Wollerman v. Grand Union Stores, Inc., 47 N.J. 426   (1956); Lewin v. Orbachs, Inc., 14 N.J. Super. 193 (App. Div. 1951); Maugeri v.   Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, 357 F.2d 202 (3rd Cir. 1966).</p>
<p>BURDEN OF GOING FORWARD</p>
<p>In Wollerman v. Grand Union Stores, Inc., 47 N.J. 426, 429-430 (1966), the   court held that where string beans are sold from bins on a self-service basis   there is a probability that some will fall or be dropped on the floor either by   defendants employees or by customers. Since plaintiff would not be in a position   to prove whether a particular string bean was dropped by an employee or another   customer (or how long it was on the floor) a showing of this type of operation   is sufficient to put the burden on the defendant to come forward with proof that   defendant did what was reasonably necessary (made periodic inspections and   clean-up) in order to protect a customer against the risk of injury likely to be   generated by defendants mode of operation. Presumably, however, the burden of   proof remains on plaintiff to prove lack of reasonable care on defendants part.   If defendant fails to produce evidence of reasonable care, the jury may infer   that the fault was probably his. See also: Bozza, supra, 42 N.J. at 359.</p>
<p>Whether or not defendant has furnished an invitee with a reasonably safe   place for his/her use may depend upon the obviousness of the condition claimed   to be hazardous and the likelihood that the invitee would realize the hazard and   protect himself/herself against it. Even though an unsafe condition may be   observable by an invitee the jury members may find that an owner (or occupier)   of premises is negligent, nevertheless, in maintaining such a condition when the   condition presents an unreasonable hazard to invitees in the circumstances of a   particular case. If the jury members find that defendant was negligent in   maintaining an unsafe condition, even though the condition would be obvious to   an invitee, the fact that the condition was obvious should be considered by the   jury members in determining whether the invitee was contributorily negligent (a)   in proceeding in the face of a known hazard or (b) in the manner in which the   invitee proceeded in the face of a known hazard.</p>
<p>DISTRACTION OR FORGETFULNESS OF INVITEE</p>
<p>Even if the jury members find that plaintiff knew of the existence of the   unsafe or defective condition, or that the unsafe or defective condition was so   obvious that defendant had a reasonable basis to expect that an invitee would   realize its existence, plaintiff may still recover if the circumstances or   conditions are such that plaintiffs attention would be distracted so that he/she   would not realize or would forget the location or existence of the hazard or   would fail to protect himself/herself against it.</p>
<p>Thus, even where a hazardous condition is obvious the jury members must first   determine whether in the circumstances the defendant was negligent in permitting   the condition to exist. Even if defendant was negligent, however, if plaintiff   knew that a hazardous condition existed, plaintiff could not recover if he/she   was contributorily negligent, that is to say, plaintiff could not recover if   he/she did not act as a reasonably prudent person either by proceeding in the   face of a known danger or by not using reasonable care in the manner in which   he/she proceeded in the face of the danger. In considering whether plaintiff was   contributorily negligent the jury members may consider that even persons of   reasonable prudence in certain circumstances may have their attention distracted   so that they would not realize or remember the existence of a hazardous   condition and would fail to protect themselves against it. Mere lapse of memory   or inattention or mental abstraction at the critical moment is not an adequate   excuse. One who is inattentive or forgetful of a known and obvious danger is   contributorily negligent unless there is some condition or circumstance which   would distract or divert the mind or attention of a reasonably prudent   person.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>In McGrath v. American Cyanamid Co., 41 N.J. 272 (1963), the employee of a   subcontractor was killed when a plank comprising a catwalk over a deep trench   up-ended causing him to fall. The court held that even if the decedent had   appreciated the danger that fact by itself would not have barred recovery. The   court said if the danger was one which due care would not have avoided, due care   might, nevertheless, require notice of warning unless the danger was known or   obvious. If the danger was created by a breach of defendants duty of care, that   negligence would not be dissipated merely because the decedent knew of the   danger. Negligence would remain, but decedents knowledge would affect the issue   of contributory negligence. The issue would remain whether decedent acted as a   reasonably prudent person in view of the known risk, either by incurring the   known risk (by staying on the job), or by the manner in which he proceeded in   the face of that risk.</p>
<p>In Zentz v. Toop, 92 N.J. Super. 105, 114-115 (App. Div. 1966), affirmed   o.b., 50 N.J. 250 (1967), the employee of a roofing contractor, while carrying   hot tar, tripped over a guide wire supporting an air conditioning tower on a   roof. The court held that even if plaintiff had observed the wires or if they   were so obvious that he/she should have observed them, the question remained   whether, considering the hazard and the work of the employee, he/she was   entitled to more than mere knowledge of the existence of the wires or whether   he/she was entitled to a warning by having the wires flagged or painted in a   contrasting color. This was a fact for the jury to determine. The jury must also   determine whether defendant had reason to expect that the employees attention   would have been distracted as he/she worked or that he/she would forget the   location of a known hazard or fail to protect himself against it. The court also   held the plaintiffs knowledge of the danger would not alone bar his/her   recovery, but this knowledge goes to the issue of contributory negligence.</p>
<p>In Ferrie v. DArc, 31 N.J. 92, 95 (1959), the court held that there was no   reasonable excuse for plaintiffs forgetfulness or inattention to the fact that a   railing was temporarily absent from her porch, as she undertook to throw bones   to her dog, and fell to the ground because of the absence of a railing she   customarily leaned upon. The court held: When an injury results from   forgetfulness or inattention to a known danger, the obvious contributory   negligence is not excusable in the absence of some condition or circumstance   which would divert the mind or attention of an ordinarily prudent man. Mere   lapse of memory, or inattention or mental abstraction at the critical moment   cannot be considered an adequate diversion. One who is inattentive to or   forgetful of a known and obvious condition which contains a risk of injury is   obvious condition which contains a risk of injury to guilty of contributory   negligence as a matter of law, unless some diversion of the type referred to   above is shown to have existed at the time.</p>
<p>The following discussion in 2 Harper &amp; James, Torts, Â§27.13, pp. 1489 et   seq., (1956), cited with approval in Zentz v. Toop, supra, 92 N.J. Super. at   112, may be helpful in understanding the principles involved in the above   charges:</p>
<p>Once an occupier has learned of dangerous conditions on his/her premises, a   serious question arises as to whether he/she may--as a matter of law under all   circumstances--discharge all further duty to his/her invitees by simply giving   them a warning adequate to enable them to avoid the harm. A good many   authorities, including the Restatement, take the position that he/she may. But   this proposition is a highly doubtful one both on principle and authority. The   alternative would be a requirement of due care to make the conditions reasonably   safe--a requirement which might well be satisfied by warning or obviousness in   any given case, but which would not be so satisfied invariably.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>1. Defendants duty. People can hurt themselves on almost any condition of the   premises. That is certainly true of an ordinary flight of stairs. But it takes   more than this to make a condition unreasonably dangerous. If people who are   likely to encounter a condition may be expected to take perfectly good care   themselves without further precautions, then the condition is not unreasonably   dangerous because the likelihood of harm is slight. This is true of the flight   of ordinary stairs in a usual place in the daylight. It is also true of ordinary   curbing along a sidewalk, doors or windows in a house, counters in a store,   stones and slopes in a New England field, and countless other things which are   common in our everyday experience. It may also be true of less common and   obvious conditions which lurk in a place where visitors would expect to find   such dangers. The ordinary person can use or encounter all of these things   safely if he/she is fully aware of their presence at the time. And if they have   no unusual features and are in a place where he/she would naturally look for   them, he/she may be expected to take care of himself if they are plainly   visible. In such cases it is enough if the condition is obvious, or is made   obvious (e.g., by illumination). * * *</p>
<p>On the other hand, the fact that a condition is obvious--i.e., it would be   clearly visible to one whose attention was directed to it--does not always   remove all unreasonable danger. It may fail to do so in two lines of cases. In   one line of cases, people would not in fact expect to find the condition where   it is, or they are likely to have their attention distracted as they approach   it, or, for some other reason, they are in fact not likely to see it, though it   could be readily and safely avoided if they did. There may be negligence in   creating or maintaining such a condition even though it is physically obvious;   slight obstructions to travel on a sidewalk an unexpected step in a store aisle   or between a passenger elevator and the landing furnish examples. Under the   circumstances of any particular case, an additional warning may, as a matter of   fact, suffice to remove the danger, as where a customer, not hurried by crowds   or some emergency, and in possession of his/her facilities, is told to watch   his/her step or step up at the appropriate time. When this is the case, the   warning satisfies the requirement of due care and is incompatible with   defendants negligence. Here again, plaintiffs recovery would be prevented by   thatfact no matter how careful he/she was. But under ordinary negligence   principles the question is properly one of fact for the jury except in the   clearest situations.</p>
<p>In the second line of cases the condition of danger is suchthat it cannot be   encountered with reasonable safety even if the danger is known and appreciated.   An icy flight of stairs or sidewalk, a slippery floor, a defective crosswalk, or   a walkway near an exposed high tension wire may furnish examples. So may the   less dangerous kind of condition if surrounding circumstances are likely to   force plaintiff upon it, or if, for any other reason, his/her knowledge is not   likely to be a protection against danger. It is in these situations that the bit   of the Restatements adequate warning rule is felt. Here, if people are in fact   likely to encounter the danger, the duty of reasonable care to make conditions   reasonably safe is not satisfied by a simple warning; the probability of harm in   spite of such precaution is still unreasonably great. And the books are full of   cases in which defendants, owing such a duty, are held liable for creating or   maintaining a perfectly obvious danger of which plaintiffs are fully aware. The   Restatement, however, would deny liability here because the occupier need not   invite visitors, and if he/she does, he/she may condition the invitation on any   terms he/she chooses, so long as there is full disclosure of them. If the   invitee wishes to come on those terms, he/she assumes the risk.</p>
<p>The Restatement view is wrong in policy. The law has never freed   landownership or possession from all restrictions or obligations imposed in the   social interest. The possessors duty to use care towards those outside the land   is of long standing. And many obligations are imposed for the benefit of people   who voluntarily come upon the land. For the invitee, the occupier must make   reasonable inspection and give warning of hidden perils. . . But this should not   be conclusive. Reasonable expectations may raise duties, but they should not   always limit them. The gist of the matter is unreasonable probability of harm in   fact. And when that is great enough in spite of full disclosure, it is carrying   the quasi-sovereignty of the landowner pretty far to let him ignore it to the   risk of life and limb.</p>
<p>So far as authority goes, the orthodox theory is getting to be a pretty   feeble reed for defendants to lean on. It is still frequently stated, though   often by way of dictum. On the other hand, some cases have simply--though   unostentatiously--broken with tradition and held defendant liable to an invitee   in spite of his/her knowledge of the danger, when the danger was great enough   and could have been feasibly remedied. Other cases stress either the reasonable   assumption of safety which the invitee may make or the likelihood that his/her   attention will be distracted, in order to cut down the notion of what is obvious   or the adequacy of warning. And the latter is often a jury question even under   the Restatement rule. It is not surprising, then, that relatively few decisions   have depended on the Restatement rule alone for denying liability.</p>
<p>2. Contributory Negligence. . . But there are several situations in which a   plaintiff will not be barred by contributory negligence although he/she   encountered a known danger. . . For another, it is not necessarily negligent for   a plaintiff knowingly and deliberately to encounter a danger which it is   negligent for defendant to maintain. Thus a traveler may knowingly use a   defective sidewalk, or a tenant a defective common stairway, without being   negligent if the use was reasonable under all the circumstances.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION These situations show that the invitee will not always be barred   by his/her self-exposure to known dangers on the premises.</p>
