<p>QUESTION #71: What is my share of my spouse's estate if I elect to take   against the will of my deceased spouse?</p>
<p>In general, a surviving spouse dissatisfied with his or her share under the   will of the deceased spouse may renounce the will and elect to take his or her   statutory share of the testator√≠s entire estate. The surviving spouse is   entitled to one-third of the estate provided that at the time of death, the   surviving spouse and decedent had not been living separate and apart in   different habitations. Generally, the surviving spouse must elect to take   his/her elective share by filing a complaint within six months after the   appointment of a personal representative of the decedent's estate.</p>
<p>Whether to elect to take against a Will is a decision that cannot be made   without comprehensive information regarding the affairs of the spouses. This is   not a matter for self-help and referral to an attorney familiar with estate   administration is normally required.</p>

<p>b. The value of the property described in subsection a. hereof which has been   transferred by the surviving spouse or domestic partner at any time during   marriage or domestic partnership without a full consideration in money or   money's worth to any person other than the decedent which would have been   includable in the spouse's or domestic partner's augmented estate if the   surviving spouse or domestic partner had predeceased the decedent.</p>

<p><br />
  3B:8-7. Property derived from decedent.</p>

<p>The right of election of a surviving spouse or domestic partner and the   rights of the surviving spouse or domestic partner may be waived, wholly or   partially, before or after marriage before, on or after May 28, 1980, by a   written contract, agreement or waiver, signed by the party waiving after fair   disclosure. Unless it provides to the contrary, a waiver of &quot;all rights&quot; (or   equivalent language) in the property or estate of a present or prospective   spouse or domestic partner or a complete property settlement entered into after   or in anticipation of separation, divorce or termination of a domestic   partnership is a waiver of all rights to an elective share by each spouse or   domestic partner in the property of the other and a renunciation by each of all   benefits which would otherwise pass to him from the other by intestate   succession or by virtue of the provisions of any will executed before the waiver   or property settlement.</p>
<p>Amended 2005, c.331, s.15.</p>
<p>3B:8-11. Who may exercise the right to take an elective share.</p>
<p>The right of election to take an elective share by a surviving spouse or   domestic partner may be exercised only during his lifetime. In the case of a   surviving spouse or domestic partner for whom the court has appointed a guardian   to manage his estate, the right of election may be exercised only by order of   the court making the appointment after finding that the election is necessary to   provide adequate support of the surviving spouse or domestic partner during his   probable life expectancy.</p>
<p>Amended 2005, c.331, s.16.</p>
<p>3B:8-12. Filing complaint for elective share; extension of time.</p>
<p>The surviving spouse or domestic partner may elect to take his elective share   in the augmented estate by filing a complaint in the Superior Court within 6   months after the appointment of a personal representative of the decedent's   estate. The court may, before the time for election has expired and upon good   cause shown by the surviving spouse or domestic partner, extend the time for   election upon notice to persons interested in the estate and to distributees and   recipients of portions of the augmented estate whose interests will be adversely   affected by the taking of the elective share.</p>
<p>Amended 2005, c.331, s.17.</p>
<p>3B:8-13. Notice of hearing.</p>
<p>The surviving spouse or domestic partner shall give notice of the time and   place set for hearing to persons interested in the estate and to the   distributees and recipients of portions of the augmented estate whose interests   will be adversely affected by the taking of the elective share.</p>
<p>Amended 2005, c.331, s.18.</p>
<p>3B:8-14 Withdrawal of demand for an elective share.</p>
<p><br />
  The surviving spouse or domestic partner may withdraw his demand for an   elective share at any time before entry of a final judgment by the court.</p>
<p>Amended 2005, c.331, s.19.</p>
<p>3B:8-15. Fixing amount of elective share; payment of elective share<br />
  The   court shall determine the amount of the elective share and shall order its   payment from the assets of the augmented estate or by contribution as appears   appropriate in the manner as hereinafter set forth in this chapter. If it   appears that a fund or property included in the augmented estate has not come   into the possession of the personal representative, or has been distributed by   the personal representative, the court nevertheless shall fix the liability of   any person who has any interest in the fund or property or who has possession   thereof, whether as trustee or otherwise. The proceeding may be maintained   against fewer than all persons against whom relief could be sought, but no   person is subject to contribution in any greater amount than he would have been   if relief had been secured against all persons subject to contribution.</p>
<p><br />
  3B:8-16. Enforcing judgment<br />
  The judgment of the court made pursuant to   N.J.S. 3B:8-15 may be enforced as other judgments are enforced by law.</p>
<p><br />
  3B:8-17. Value of surviving spouse's or domestic partner's interest in   any life estate.</p>
<p>3B:8-17. Value of surviving spouse's or domestic partner's interest in any   life estate.<br />
  In an action for an elective share, the electing spouse's or   domestic partner's total or proportional beneficial interest in any life estate   in real or personal property or in any trust shall be valued at one-half of the   total value of the property or trust or of the portion of the property or trust   subject to the life estate.</p>
<p>Amended 2005, c.331, s.20.</p>
<p><br />
  3B:8-18. Satisfaction of elective share.</p>
<p>The amount of the surviving spouse's or domestic partner's elective share   shall be satisfied by applying:</p>
<p>a. The value of all property, estate or interest therein, owned by the   surviving spouse or domestic partner in his own right at the time of the   decedent's death from whatever source acquired, or succeeded to by the surviving   spouse or domestic partner as a result of decedent's death notwithstanding that   the property, estate or interest or part thereof, succeeded to by the surviving   spouse or domestic partner as the result of decedent's death has been renounced   by the surviving spouse or domestic partner;</p>
<p>b. The value of the property described in subsection b. of N.J.S. 3B:8-6,   and</p>
<p>c. The remaining property of the augmented estate is so applied that   liability for the balance of the elective share of the surviving spouse or   domestic partner is equitably apportioned among the recipients of the augmented   estate in proportion to the value of their interests therein.</p>
<p>Amended 2005, c.331, s.21.</p>
<p><br />
  3B:8-19. Persons subject to contribution.</p>
<p>Only original transferees from, or appointees of, the decedent and their   donees, to the extent the donees have the property or its proceeds, are subject   to the contribution to make up the elective share of the surviving spouse or   domestic partner. A person liable to contribution may choose to give up the   property transferred to him or to pay its value as fixed in the manner provided   in N.J.S. 3B:8-4.</p>
<p>Amended 2005, c.331, s.22.</p>
