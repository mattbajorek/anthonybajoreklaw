<p align="center">
<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC represents individuals charged with speeding more   than 15 miles over the speed limit an other serious traffic violations   throughout New Jersey.</p>
<p>It is well established that the prosecution of a defendant for a motor   vehicle violation is a quasi-criminal proceeding. In such a proceeding the   burden of proof is upon the state to establish all elements of the offense   beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>In every charge of a speeding violation, the complaint or summons must   specify (l) the speed at which the defendant is alleged to have driven, (2) the   speed which is prima facie unlawful, and (3) the time and place of the alleged   violation.</p>
<p>A sign showing a speed limit is merely notice of the law or an ordinance or   regulation prohibiting a greater speed. The sign itself does not set the speed   limit. There can be no conviction for violation of the edict of a posted sign,   but only for violation of the statute, ordinance, or regulation having the force   of law. There are many unauthorized signs in the state which may serve as a   warning but have no effect in creating an offense. Radar</p>
<p>Speed-measuring radar in various forms has been accepted since State v.   Dantonio, l8 N.J. 570 (l955), where the N.J. Supreme Court held it is not   essential that the court determine the precise speed at which the vehicle was   being operated when the alleged offense occurred, and that the operator of the   vehicle must be adjudged guilty if the evidence established, beyond a reasonable   doubt, that the drive exceeded the statutory speed limit.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for the trial court to make a particular finding as to   the precise speed in excess of the speed limit at which the defendant was   traveling at the time of the violation. State v. Bookbinder, 82 N.J. Super. l79,   l83 (App. Div. l964).</p>
<p>However, if the defendant is found guilty, the trial court should determine   the quantum of excess was so many miles per hour in exercising its discretion as   to the penalty to be imposed within the statutory limitation. The precise speed   a motorist was traveling thus is material only on the question as to the penalty   to be imposed, not on the question of guilt or innocence.</p>
<p>State v. Readding, l69 N.J. Super. 238 (Law Div. l978), restated the general   rule that in order for the radar speedometer reading to be admissible into   evidence, it should be established that: (l) the device is scientifically   reliable; (2) the particular speedometer used in the case being tried is   accurate; (3) the operator is qualified; and (4) the device was operated   properly in the case being tried. How Radar Operates</p>
<p>In State v. Wojtkowiak, l70 N.J. Super. 44 (Law Div. l979), revd on other   grounds, l74 N.J. Super. 460, Judge Wells examined in detail the K-55 Radar, and   his conclusions were incorporated by the Appellate Division. This case should be   read and reread for a detailed explanation of Radar by a Court.</p>
<p>The traffic radar method speed detection measurement depends upon the Doppler   effect. Simply stated a radio wave which strikes a moving object is reflected   from that object at different frequency from that of the incident wave. A radar   which transmits waves and receives reflected waves can determine their frequency   difference and calculate the speed of the object which produced the reflective   wave.</p>
<p>Courts have accepted as scientifically reliable MPH Industries K-55 Traffic   Radar -- the primary system employed for the purpose of measuring the speed of   motor vehicles in New Jersey.</p>
<p>In State v. Wojtkowiak, l74 N.J. Super, 460 (App. Div. l980), the appeals   court held in all future cases the state should adduce evidence at the municipal   court level as to (l) the specific training and extent of experience of the   officer operating the radar, (2) the calibration of the machine was checked by   at least two external tuning forks both singly and in combination, and (3) the   calibration of the speedometer of the patrol car in cases where the K-55 is   operating in the moving mode.</p>
<p>MPH Industries, manufacturer and distributor of the K-55, sets forth the   following eight points an officer must be able to testify to:</p>
<p>* The officer must establish the time, place and location of the radar device   at the time he made the reading. * The officer must be able to identify the   vehicle. * The officer must identify the defendant as the operator of the   vehicle * The officer must testify that he made a visual observation of the   vehicle and that it was going at an excessive rate of speed. * At the time of   the radar reading the officer must testify that the vehicle was out front, by   itself, nearest to the radar. * The officer must state his qualifications and   training in radar use. * The officer must establish that the radar was tested   for accuracy both prior and after its use. * If used in the moving mode, that at   the time of the radar reading the patrol speed indicated on the unit compared to   the speedometer of the police vehicle.</p>
<p>Qualified Operator?</p>
<p>While it appeared to the court in State v. Wojtkowiak, Supra that the K-55   Radar is an accurate and reliable tool for the measurement of speed, its   accuracy and reliability in any case are no better than the skill of the person   operating the radar. Id. at l74. The court made this emphasis as a warning to   all police departments that proper courses of instruction be developed before   the K-55 Radar device is employed in any municipality.</p>
<p>A calibration check is accomplished with the use of two tuning forks and   their accuracy must be the subject of the documentary proof. Use of the K-55   does not eliminate the need for such proof. State v. Wojtkowiak, l70 N.J. Super.   at 50, n.l</p>
<p>In State v. Overton, l35 N.J. Super 443 (Cty. Ct. l975), four external tuning   forks were used to test the radar unit l2 times within a period of approximately   90 minutes. The court noted there is authority to the effect that a radar unit   should be checked for accuracy each time it is set up at a different location.   MPH Industries argues this is not necessary with moving radar.</p>
<p>In State v. Readding, l60 N.J. Super. 238 (Law Div. l978), the court   reiterated the decision in State v. Overton, l35 N.J. Super. 443 (Cty. Ct.   l975), where the court found there are three universally accepted methods of   testing the accurate operation of a radar speed measuring device:</p>
<p>1. By use of the internal tuning fork built into the machine itself (which   the court found to be improper). 2. By running the patrol car with a calibrated   speedometer through the &quot;zone of influence&quot; of the radar machine. 3. By use of   external tuning forks calibrated at set speeds and which emit sound waves or   frequencies identical to those which would come from a vehicle traveling through   the Radar bearer at the same speed for which the tuning fork has been cut.</p>
<p>It is also important to recognize that in State v. Readding, l60 N.J. Super.   238, the court stated: the proper operation of the device must be proved,   usually by detailed reference by the qualified operator to the procedures called   for by the manufacturer of the device. Tuning Forks</p>
<p>Before a radar speed reading is admissible, the state must establish the   machine was operating properly. MPH Industries test procedure uses two tuning   forks: First, the lower-speed fork is struck on wood or plastic and the ringing   fork is held in a fixed position two to three inches in front of the antenna   with the harrow edge of the fork facing the antenna front. This will cause the   Patrol Monitor Window to display the forks speed. While continuing to hold this   ringing fork in place, the higher-speed fork is struck and held next to the   lower-speed fork (both forks must be vibrating while being held an equal   distance from the antenna. The target should then display the &quot;speed&quot; difference   between the two forks. For example, if the forks used are 35 mph and 65 mph,   then the target window will display the difference, which is 30 mph.   Admissibility of Evidence</p>
<p>The state must establish through documentary evidence the tuning fork itself   was accurate. The state must produce and be able to admit into evidence   certificates as proof of the accuracy of the devices used for testing the proper   operation of the machine.</p>
<p>In State v. Cardone, l46 N.J. Super. 23 (App. Div. l976), the court held that   while certificates do not have to satisfy the normal rules of evidence, an   Evidence Rule 8 hearing still must be held, at which the court can determine   preliminary issues of admissibility of evidence. In such a hearing, the rules of   evidence -- except for Rule 4 or a valid claim of privilege -- do not apply. Id.   at 28.</p>
<p>The Cardone court found that the certificates of calibration and accuracy of   the radar machine -- and for the tuning forks used to test the machine -- were   properly admitted in evidence, even though no proof was offered to qualifying   the certificates as records made in the regular course of business. The   certificates were used solely as evidence of proper operating conditions or as a   prerequisite to the admissibility of the radar reading, and the defendant made   no effort to prove the internal calibrating device or the tuning forks were   inaccurate.</p>
<p>Previously, in State v. Overton, l35 N.J. Super. 443 (Cty. Ct. l975), it was   held the municipal court judge improperly admitted certificates issued by the   manufacturer of the tuning forks and the radar unit itself. The court also held   the certificates were not properly authenticated, as required by Evidence Rule   67, nor was there sufficient testimony to support their admissibility as either   business records under Evidence Rule 63(l3) or as reports of finding of a public   official under Evidence Rule 63(l5).</p>
<p>In State v. Readding, supra, the Superior Court exonerated the defendant,   stating:</p>
<p>It is entirely possible for a particular RADAR device to function properly   and record accurately a 50 m.p.h. but inaccurately at higher speeds......</p>
<p>Accuracy of the particular speedometer should be established by more than one   test. The Pace or Clock Method</p>
<p>A &quot;pace&quot; or &quot;clock&quot; is performed by an officer in a patrol car with a   calibrated speedometer for a duration of distance or time wherein the officer   accelerated to a speed equivalent to the suspects, and then keeps a steady   distance behind the suspects vehicle following that vehicle. It is essential   that the patrol cars speedometer be calibrated and that the certificates of   calibration both before and after, be admitted into evidence.</p>
<p>An officer may also sometimes admit he was unable to get a good &quot;clock&quot; but   may say that his vehicle was going 70 mph, for example, and he was still losing   ground to the offender. The obvious shortcoming to &quot;clocking&quot; as vehicle is that   the officers objective judgment may be brought into question, the interference   by other traffic, or other non-reasonable factors. It is for these reasons that   the &quot;clock&quot; method is used less frequently than radar. Conclusion</p>
<p>It is no defense to argue unlawful arrest, selective enforcement, custom and   usage, non-ownership of car driven, ignorance or mistake of law, lack of precise   speed proved, defective speedometer or cruise control. Obey the law, follow   speed limits and you will have no need to know about Radar.</p>
