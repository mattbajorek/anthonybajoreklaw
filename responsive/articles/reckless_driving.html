<p>39:4-130. Immediate notice of accident; written report [Failure to   report]</p>
<p>39:4-130. The driver of a vehicle or street car involved in an accident   resulting in injury to or death of any person, or damage to property of any one   person in excess of $500.00 shall by the quickest means of communication give   notice of such accident to the local police department or to the nearest office   of the county police of the county or of the State Police, and in addition shall   within 10 days after such accident forward a written report of such accident to   the division on forms furnished by it. Such written reports shall contain   sufficiently detailed information with reference to a motor vehicle accident,   including the cause, the conditions then existing, the persons and vehicles   involved and such information as may be necessary to enable the director to   determine whether the requirements for the deposit of security required by law   are inapplicable by reason of the existence of insurance or other circumstances.   The director may rely upon the accuracy of the information contained in any such   report, unless he has reason to believe that the report is erroneous. The   division may require operators involved in accidents to file supplemental   reports of accidents upon forms furnished by it when in the opinion of the   division, the original report is insufficient. The reports shall be without   prejudice, shall be for the information of the division, and shall not be open   to public inspection. The fact that the reports have been so made shall be   admissible in evidence solely to prove a compliance with this section, but no   report or any part thereof or statement contained therein shall be admissible in   evidence for any other purpose in any proceeding or action arising out of the   accident.</p>
<p>Whenever the driver of a vehicle is physically incapable of giving immediate   notice or making a written report of an accident as required in this section and   there was another occupant in the vehicle at the time of the accident capable of   giving notice or making a report, such occupant shall make or cause to be made   said notice or report not made by the driver.</p>
<p>Whenever the driver is physically incapable of making a written report of an   accident as required by this section and such driver is not the owner of the   vehicle, then the owner of the vehicle involved in such accident shall make such   report not made by the driver.</p>
<p>A written report of an accident shall not be required by this section if a   law enforcement officer submits a written report of the accident to the division   pursuant to R.S. 39:4-131.</p>
<p>Any person who knowingly violates this section shall be fined not less than   $30 or more than $100.</p>
<p>The director may revoke or suspend the operators license privilege and   registration privilege of a person who violates this section.</p>
<p>For purposes of this section, it shall not be a defense that the operator of   the motor vehicle was unaware of the existence or extent of personal injury or   property damage caused by the accident as long as the operator was aware that he   was involved in an accident.</p>
<p>Amended 1951, c.23,s.72; 1953,c.187; 1967,c.189,s.2; 1983,c.193,s.1;   1994,c.183,s.2.</p>
