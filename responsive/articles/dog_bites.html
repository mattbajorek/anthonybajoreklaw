<p>If someone hops your fence, trespasses on your land, and your dog bites him,   you are not liable. However, New Jersey does impose strict liability if your dog   bites someone if it is loose or if the person bitten was in a public place or   permitted on your property. NJSA 4:19-16 provides:</p>
<p>&quot;The owner of any dog which shall bite a person while such person is on or in   a public place, or lawfully on or in a private place, including the property of   the owner of the dog, shall be liable for such damages as may be suffered by the   person bitten, regardless of the former viciousness of such dog or the owner's   knowledge of such viciousness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For the purpose of the New Jersey Statute 4:19-16, a person is lawfully upon   the private property of such owner when he is on the property in the performance   of any duty imposed upon him by the laws of this state or the laws or postal   regulations of the United States, or when he is on such property upon the   invitation, express or implied, of the owner thereof.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus, in New Jersey, a dog does not get two bites.</p>
<p>A person can even be liable if your dog injures someone although not biting   it. Being jumped on or chased by a dog could be grounds for a civil liability.   It is also strict liability if any of your dangerous animals injure someone,   i.e. pet, buffalo or tiger.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this state law, a person is lawfully upon the private   property of such owner when he/she is on the property in the performance of any   duty imposed upon him by the laws of this state or the laws or postal   regulations of the United States, or when he/she is on such property upon the   invitation, express or implied, of the owner thereof.</p>
<p>In deciding whether the plaintiff was on or in a public place or lawfully on   or in a private place, including the property of the defendant, you should note   that anyone whose presence is expressly or impliedly permitted on the property   is entitled to the protection of the statute. The permission extends to all   areas where the plaintiff may reasonably believe to be included within its   scope. DeRobertis v. Randazzo, 94 N.J. 144 (1983).</p>
<p>In a case such as this where the defendant has raised the negligence of the   plaintiff as a defense, the defendant has the burden of proof. This means that   the defendant has the burden to prove plaintiff's &quot;unreasonable and voluntary   exposure to a known risk.&quot; This means that the plaintiff &quot;knew&quot; the dog had a   propensity to bite either because of the dog's known viciousness or because of   the plaintiff's deliberate acts intended to incite the animal. For example, one   who beats or torments a dog has no call upon the owner if in self-defense the   dog bites back. Budai v. Teague, 212 N.J. Super. 522 (Law Div. 1986); see also   Dranow v. Kolmar, 92 N.J.L. 114, 116-17 (1918). In conclusion, a New Jersey dog   does not get two bites. Keep your dog fenced in or tied up and away from mailman   and visiting friends.</p>
<p>Updated dog liability statutes: 4:19-16. Liability of owner regardless of   viciousness of dog The owner of any dog which shall bite a person while such   person is on or in a public place, or lawfully on or in a private place,   including the property of the owner of the dog, shall be liable for such damages   as may be suffered by the person bitten, regardless of the former viciousness of   such dog or the owner's knowledge of such viciousness.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this section, a person is lawfully upon the private   property of such owner when he is on the property in the performance of any duty   imposed upon him by the laws of this state or the laws or postal regulations of   the United States, or when he is on such property upon the invitation, express   or implied, of the owner thereof.</p>
<p>4:19-17. Findings, declarations The Legislature finds and declares that   certain dogs are an increasingly serious and widespread threat to the safety and   welfare of citizens of this State by virtue of their unprovoked attacks on, and   associated injury to, individuals and other animals; that these attacks are in   part attributable to the failure of owners to confine and properly train and   control these dogs; that existing laws at the local level inadequately address   this problem; and that it is therefore appropriate and necessary to impose a   uniform set of State requirements on the owners of vicious or potentially   dangerous dogs.</p>

<p>(1) to apply, at his own expense, to the municipal clerk or other official   designated to license dogs pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1941, c.151   (C.4:19-15.2), for a special municipal potentially dangerous dog license,   municipal registration number, and red identification tag issued pursuant to   section 14 of this act. The owner shall, at his own expense, have the   registration number tattooed upon the dog in a prominent location. A potentially   dangerous dog shall be impounded until the owner obtains a municipal potentially   dangerous dog license, municipal registration number, and red identification   tag;</p>
<p>(2) to display, in a conspicuous manner, a sign on his premises warning that   a potentially dangerous dog is on the premises. The sign shall be visible and   legible from 50 feet of the enclosure required pursuant to paragraph (3) of this   subsection;</p>
<p>(3) to immediately erect and maintain an enclosure for the potentially   dangerous dog on the property where the potentially dangerous dog will be kept   and maintained, which has sound sides, top and bottom to prevent the potentially   dangerous dog from escaping by climbing, jumping or digging and within a fence   of at least six feet in height separated by at least three feet from the   confined area. The owner of a potentially dangerous dog shall securely lock the   enclosure to prevent the entry of the general public and to preclude any release   or escape of a potentially dangerous dog by an unknowing child or other person.   All potentially dangerous dogs shall be confined in the enclosure or, if taken   out of the enclosure, securely muzzled and restrained with a tether approved by   the animal control officer and having a minimum tensile strength sufficiently in   excess of that required to restrict the potentially dangerous dog's movements to   a radius of no more than three feet from the owner and under the direct   supervision of the owner;</p>
<p>b. may require the owner to maintain liability insurance in an amount   determined by the municipal court to cover any damage or injury caused by the   potentially dangerous dog. The liability insurance, which may be separate from   any other homeowner policy, shall contain a provision requiring the municipality   in which the owner resides to be named as an additional insured for the sole   purpose of being notified by the insurance company of any cancellation,   termination or expiration of the liability insurance policy.</p>

The owner shall incur the   expense of impounding the dog in a facility other than the municipal pound,   regardless of whether the dog is ultimately found to be vicious or potentially   dangerous.</p>
<p>b. If the dog has bitten or exposed a person within 10 days previous to the   time of euthanasia, its head shall be transported to the New Jersey State   Department of Health laboratory for rabies testing.</p>

<p>b. notify the licensing authority, local police department or force, and the   animal control officer if a potentially dangerous dog is at large, or has   attacked a human being or killed a domestic animal;</p>
<p>c. notify the licensing authority, local police department or force, and the   animal control officer within 24 hours of the death, sale or donation of a   potentially dangerous dog;</p>

<p>e. upon the sale or donation of the dog to a person residing in a different   municipality, notify the department and the licensing authority, police   department or force, and animal control officer of that municipality of the   transfer of ownership and the name, address and telephone of the new owner;   and</p>
<p>f. in addition to any license fee required pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1941,   c.151 (C.4:19-15.3), pay a potentially dangerous dog license fee to the   municipality as provided by section 15 of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-31).</p>

The municipal   court shall have jurisdiction to enforce this section. An animal control officer   is authorized to seize and impound any potentially dangerous dog whose owner   fails to comply with the provisions of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.), or   any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or a court's order. The   municipal court may order that the dog so seized and impounded be destroyed in   an expeditious and humane manner.</p>
