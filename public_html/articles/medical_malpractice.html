<p>Duty and Negligence</p>
<p>Negligence is conduct which deviates from a standard of care required by law   for the protection of persons from harm. Negligence may result from the   performance of an act or the failure to act. The determination of whether a   defendant was negligent requires a comparison of the defendant's conduct against   a standard of care. If the defendant's conduct is found to have fallen below an   accepted standard of care, then he or she was negligent.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge May Furnish Standard of Care</p>
<p>Negligence is the failure to comply with the standard of care to protect a   person from harm. Negligence in a doctor's medical practice, which is called   malpractice, is the doctor's failure to comply with the standard of care in the   care and treatment of his/her patient. Usually it is necessary to establish the   standard of care by expert testimony, that is, by testimony of persons who are   qualified by their training, study and experience to give their opinions on   subjects not generally understood by persons, such as jurors, who lack such   special training or experience. In the usual case the standard of care by which   to judge the defendant's conduct cannot be determined by the jury without the   assistance of expert medical testimony.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, such as the case at hand, the jury may determine from   its common knowledge and experience the standard of care by which to judge the   defendant's conduct. In this case plaintiff contends that the defendant violated   the duty of care he/she owed to the plaintiff by doing   ____________________________ [ or by failing to do the following   ____________________]. In this case, therefore, it is for you, as jurors, to   determine, based upon common knowledge and experience, what skill and care the   average physician practicing in the defendant's field would have exercised in   the same or similar circumstances. It is for you as jurors to say from your   common knowledge and experience whether the defendant deviated from the standard   of care in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p>Where there has been expert medical testimony as to the standard of care, but   the standard is one which can also be determined by the jury from its common   knowledge and experience, the jury should determine the standard of care after   considering all the evidence in the case, including the expert medical   testimony, as well as its own common knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>After determining the standard of care required in the circumstances of this   case, you should then consider the evidence to determine whether the defendant   has complied with or departed from that standard of care. If you find that   defendant has complied with that standard of care he/she is not liable to the   plaintiff, regardless of the result. If you find that defendant has not complied   with that standard of care, resulting in injury or damage to the plaintiff, then   you should find defendant negligent and return a verdict for plaintiff.</p>
<p>Cases and Notes:</p>
<p>a) Common Knowledge</p>
<p>The common knowledge doctrine was applied in Martin v. Perth Amboy General   Hospital, 104 N.J. Super. 335 (App. Div. 1969), where a laparotomy pad was left   in plaintiff's body during an operation, Tramutola v. Bortone, 63 N.J. 9 (1973),   where plaintiff discovered that a needle had been left in her chest during   surgery; Steinke v. Bell, 32 N.J. Super. 67 (App. Div. 1954), where a dentist   removed the wrong tooth; Becker v. Eisenstodt, 60 N.J. Super. 240 (App. Div.   1960), where the defendant used a caustic substance instead of an anesthetic;   and Terhune v. Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital, 63 N.J. Super. 106 (App. Div.   1960), where plaintiff was burned as a result of the improper administration of   an anesthetic during childbirth, Nowacki v. Community Medical Center , 279 N.J.   Super. 276 (App. Div. 1995), where plaintiff alleged that she fell while   attempting to lift herself onto a treatment table, Tierney v. St. Michael's, 214   N.J. Super. 27 (App. Div. 1986), certif. den. 107 N.J. 114 (1987), where   plaintiff's infant crawled out of a crib while hospitalized at the defendant   hospital, Winters v. Jersey City Medical Center , 120 N.J. Super. 129 (App. Div.   1972), where the court held that one does not need an expert witness to testify   that the bed rails should have been in the up position for an elderly person who   fell out of bed. The common knowledge doctrine was applied to a failure to   communicate an abnormal finding and the signing of an incorrect discharge   summary in Jenoff v. Gleason, 215 N.J. Super. 349 (App. Div. 1987). In Rosenberg   by Rosenberg v. Cahill, 99 N.J. 318 (1985), the common knowledge doctrine was   not applied to the failure to observe a tumor in an x-ray.</p>
<p>The court rejected the plaintiff's reliance on the common knowledge doctrine   in Posta v. Chueng-Loy, 306 N.J. Super. 182 (App. Div. 1997), involving hernia   surgery.</p>
<p>See also, Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, 34 N.J. 128 (1961), Jones v. Stess, 111 N.J.   Super. 283 (App. Div. 1970), Klimko v. Rose, 84 N.J. 496 (1980).</p>
<p>b) Res ispa loquitur</p>
<p>There are three requirements which must be demonstrated in order to apply the   doctrine of res ipsa loquitur:</p>
<p>(1) The occurrence must be one which ordinarily bespeaks negligence;</p>
<p>(2) The instrumentality causing the injury must have been within defendant's   exclusive control; and</p>
<p>(3) There must be no indication that the plaintiff's injury was in any way   the result of his own voluntary act or neglect.</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of the doctrine of res ipsa is found in Gould v. Winokur,   98 N.J. Super. 554 (Law Div. 1968), aff'd., 104 N.J. Super. 329 (App. Div.   1969), certif. den . 53 N.J. 582 (1969). See also, Buckelew v. Grossbard, 87   N.J. 512 (1981).</p>
<p>The difference between the res ipsa doctrine and the common knowledge   doctrine is that the res ipsa doctrine requires expert testimony to prove the   first element of proof, i.e., that the occurrence does not usually happen in the   absence of negligence. Smallwood v. Mitchell, 264 N.J. Super. 295 (App. Div.   1993), certif. den. 134 N.J. 481 (1993).</p>
<p>The logical extension of the res ipsa and common knowledge doctrines is the   conclusion that there are cases where the facts are such that at least one   defendant must be liable as a matter of law. The genesis of this concept in New   Jersey is found in Anderson v. Somberg, 67 N.J. 291 (1975), cert. den. 423 U.S.   929 (1975). See also, Chin v. St. Barnabas Medical Center, 160 N.J. 454   (1999).</p>
<p>The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was deemed applicable in Yerzy v. Levine,   108 N.J. Super. 222 (App. Div. 1970), aff'd. 57 N.J. 234 (1970), where the   common bile duct had been completely severed during gall bladder surgery;   Pearson v. St. Paul, 220 N.J. Super. 110 (App. Div. 1987), where plaintiff's   sixteen year old daughter died after arthroscopic knee surgery.</p>
<p>The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was deemed inapplicable in Toy v. Rickert,   53 N.J. Super. 27 (App. Div. 1958), where plaintiff alleged that the defendant   negligently administered a shot of penicillin into plaintiff's right buttock   causing nerve damage; in Renrick v. Newark, 74 N.J. Super. 200 (App. Div. 1962),   where plaintiff alleged that the defendant negligently injected a drug resulting   in severe burning of both forearms and widespread scarring; Posta v. Chueng-Loy,   306 N.J. Super. 182 (App. Div. 1997), involving hernia surgery.</p>
<p>c) Common knowledge can be employed in some cases although expert medical   testimony is also offered as to the standard of care and defendant's alleged   departure therefrom. See Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, supra, 34 N.J. at 138 and   143.</p>
<p>The Trial Judge will read the following instructions to the jury prior to the   jury deciding damages and negligence:</p>
<p>[Option A: Specialist. ] The defendant(s) in this case is (are) a medical   specialist(s) in the field of [insert appropriate specialty description].   Specialists in a field of medicine represent that they will have and employ not   merely the knowledge and skill of a general practitioner, but that they have and   will employ the knowledge and skill normally possessed and used by the average   specialist in the field. Thus, when a physician holds himself/herself out as a   specialist and undertakes to diagnose and treat the medical needs of a patient,   the law imposes a duty upon that physician to have and to use that degree of   knowledge and skill which is normally possessed and used by the average   specialist in that field, having regard to the state of scientific knowledge at   the time that he/she or she attended the plaintiff.</p>
<p>[Option B: General Practitioner.] The defendant(s) in this case is (are) a   general practitioner(s). A person who is engaged in the general practice of   medicine represents that he/she or she will have and employ knowledge and skill   normally possessed and used by the average physician practicing his/her   profession as a general practitioner.</p>
<p>[Remainder of Charge:]</p>
<p>Given what I have just said, it is important for you to know the standard of   care which a general practitioner/specialist in [insert appropriate specialty   description, if applicable] is required to observe in his/her treatment of a   patient under the circumstances of this case. Based upon common knowledge alone,   and without technical training, jurors normally cannot know what conduct   constitutes standard medical practice. Therefore, the standard of practice by   which a physician's conduct is to be judged must be furnished by expert   testimony, that is to say, by the testimony of persons who by knowledge,   training or experience are deemed qualified to testify and to express their   opinions on medical subjects.</p>
<p>You as jurors should not speculate or guess about the standards of care by   which the defendant physician(s) should have conducted   himself/herself/themselves in the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff.   Rather, you must determine the applicable medical standard from the testimony of   the expert witness(es) you have heard in this case.(1)</p>
<p>Where there is a conflict in the testimony of the medical experts on a   subject, it is for you the jury to resolve that conflict using the same   guidelines in determining credibility that I mentioned earlier. You are not   required to accept arbitrarily the opinions offered. You should consider the   expert's qualifications, training, and experience, as well as his/her   understanding of the matters to which he/she or she testified.</p>
<p>Where an expert has offered an opinion upon an assumption that certain facts   are true, it is for you, the jury, to decide whether the facts upon which the   opinion is based are true. The value and weight of an expert's testimony in such   instances is dependent upon, and no stronger than, the facts upon which it is   predicated.</p>
<p>When determining the applicable standard of care, you must focus on accepted   standards of practice in [insert general practice or specialty involved] and not   on the personal subjective belief or practice of the defendant doctor.(2)</p>
<p>The law recognizes that the practice of medicine is not an exact science.   Therefore, the practice of medicine according to accepted medical standards may   not prevent a poor or unanticipated result.(3) Therefore, whether the defendant   doctor was negligent depends not on the outcome, but on whether he/she adhered   to or departed from the applicable standard of care. Ibid.</p>
<p>Note to Judge:</p>
<p>Where the defendant has satisfied the burden of proving that medical judgment   is involved in the case, insert Charge 5.36G, Medical Judgment, here.</p>
<p>If you find that the defendant(s) has (have) complied with the accepted   standard of care, then he/she is not liable to the plaintiff regardless of the   result. On the other hand, if you find that the defendant(s) has (have) deviated   from the standard of care resulting in injury or damage to plaintiff, then you   should find defendant negligent and return a verdict for plaintiff.</p>
