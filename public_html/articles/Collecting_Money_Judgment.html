<p>How your attorney can attempt to force the deadbeat creditor to pay money   owed!</p>
<p>If money is owed you because you have been awarded a judgment by the Superior   Court or Special Civil Part, you are a judgment creditor. Attorneys usually work   on an hourly basis- between $200 /hr and up. It is usually not cost effective to   hire an attorney if the amount due is under $1,000.</p>
<p>EXECUTION ON GOODS AND CHATTELS (PERSONAL PROPERTY)</p>
<p>An execution on goods and chattels lets the court try to collect the money   owed on a judgment from the debtors bank account or personal property. (Real   estate cannot be used to collect money owed in the Special Civil Part.) You must   locate and identify the debtors personal property that can be used to satisfy   your judgment. Your attorney may, petition that a Court Officer try to sell   personal items such as office equipment, etc., at a public sale. The debtor may   keep $1,000.00 worth of personal property. If the debtor does not have $1,000.00   in personal property, this method cannot be used to satisfy your judgment and to   collect the money owed you. Vehicles- If you ask that the Court Officer seize   the debtors motor vehicle, you must be able to show that the vehicle is   registered in the name of the debtor. This is done by getting a certified copy   of the title and a certified lien search from the New Jersey Division of Motor   Vehicles. The Clerk or Court Officer will inform you of additional fees to   advertise and sell the property when and if these events occur. A writ of   execution is good for one year from the date it is issued, and can be   renewed.</p>
<p>BANK LEVY</p>
<p>If you know or can find out where the debtor has a savings or checking   account in New Jersey, your attorney may ask that a Court Officer collect your   debit from the money in the account. You must provide the number of the bank,   the address and the account number, if possible. Court Officers cannot search   for bank accounts. After the money has been levied upon by the Court Officer, it   is considered frozen. Your attorney must then file a Motion to Turn Over Funds   with the court and serve a copy upon the debtor and the bank. If the court   grants the motion, the judge will sign the Order to Turn Over Funds that you   submitted with your motion. This order will be delivered to the bank by the   Court Officer.</p>
<p>EXECUTION AGAINST WAGES</p>
<p>An execution against a persons wages can be requested if the debtor works in   New Jersey and earns more than $127.50 per week. To request a wage execution,   your attorney or you must send a Notice of Application for Wage Execution to the   debtor by regular and certified mail. A copy of the application and a statement   of how you mailed the application to the debtor must be filed with the Office of   the Clerk of the Special Civil Part. If the debtor objects to the wage   execution, a hearing will be scheduled by the court. If the debtor does not   object or the court does not allow the objection, an order for a wage execution   will be issued and the wage execution will be delivered to the debtors employer   by the Court Officer. The employer will hold back a portion of the debtors pay,   in accordance with the Order for Wage Execution and will send this money to the   Court Officer who will then send it to you.</p>
<p>Wage Execution- The court cannot levy on welfare benefits, Social Security   benefits, SSI, veterans benefits or unemployment benefits. Once you apply and   the court issues a writ of execution on goods and chattels (personal property)   or wages, it is assigned to a Special Civil Part Court Officer for collection.   By law there is a 10% fee added to the amount of the judgment as the Court   Officers commission. This fee is listed on the writ and is payable to the Court   Officer as the judgment is collected. The 10% is taken from the money collected   by the Court Officer. Once a writ of execution is issued, the payments should be   made directly to the Court Officer and not directly to you as the creditor. The   Court Officer handles the bookkeeping, deducts the appropriate commission, and   sends the balances to you. After a writ is returned by the Court Officer marked   fully satisfied, the Clerk of the Court will enter the satisfaction in the   record. In some instances, after a levy has been made by the Court Officer or   contact has been made with the debtor, settlement discussions may occur between   you and the debtor. In making a settlement with the debtor, remember that the   Officer who has made a valid levy or has in some way helped produce payment by   law receives the 10% commission on any amount paid. Any partial or full payment   made directly to you is subject to the commission that must be paid to the Court   Officer.</p>
<p>DOCKETED JUDGMENT</p>
<p>If you or a Court Officer cannot collect the money due you on the judgment,   you may have the judgment from the Special Civil Part recorded by your attorney   in the Superior Court Clerks Office in Trenton. Once your judgment is recorded   in the Superior Court, the debtor cannot sell with clear title any real estate   owned in New Jersey until your debt is paid. Once docketed, future efforts to   collect a judgment originally awarded in the Special Civil Part must be made   through the Sheriffs Office in the county where the debtors assets are   located.</p>
<p>INFORMATION SUBPOENA</p>
<p>If you do not know where the judgment debtor has a savings or checking   account, what personal property the debtor owns, or where the debtor works, your   attorney may attempt to obtain asset information by use of an information   subpoena. An information subpoena is a court paper containing questions about   the debtors assets. Your attorney will serve an original and one copy of an   information subpoena upon the debtor either personally or by registered and   certified mail, return receipt requested, and simultaneously by regular mail.   You also must provide a postage paid, addressed envelope with the information   subpoena. The debtor must answer and return the information subpoena within 14   days from the date on which it was served. An information subpoena cannot be   served more than once in a six month period without approval of the court. If   the debtor does not answer the information subpoena, he or she is subject to   contempt sanctions enforceable by the court.</p>
<p>COURT ORDER FOR DISCOVERY</p>
<p>Another approach for seeking information about a debtors assets is for your   attorney to file with the court a petition stating the amount due on the   judgment. The court issues an Order requiring the debtor or any person who has   information about the debtors assets to answer questions concerning these assets   at a place and time specified in the court order. A person may be required to   appear only once without another court order. Your attorney may serve a copy of   the order for discovery upon the debtor or other person either personally or by   registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and simultaneously by   regular mail at least 10 days before the appearance date. If the debtor or   person named in the court order does not comply with the court order and fails   to appear at the specified time and place to provide information about the   debtors assets, he or she is subject to contempt sanctions enforceable by the   court.</p>
<p>Court Rule 4:59 (e) Supplementary Proceedings. In aid of the judgment or   execution, the judgment creditor or successor in interest appearing of record,   may examine any person, including the judgment debtor, by proceeding as provided   by these rules for the taking of depositions or the judgment creditor may   proceed as provided by R. 6:7-2, except that service of an order for discovery   or an information subpoena shall be made as prescribed by R. 1:5-2 for service   on a party. The court may make any appropriate order in aid of execution. If the   warrant for arrest is not executed within 24 months after the date of the entry   of the order authorizing it, both the order and the warrant shall be deemed to   have expired and to be of no further effect.</p>
<p>COLLECTING AN OUT-OF-STATE JUDGMENT</p>
<p>Article 4 of the United States Constitution provides that a judgment awarded   in a court of one state is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of   another state. To give a judgment awarded in another state validity to be   collected in New Jersey, another lawsuit must be started in the appropriate   court in New Jersey. To attempt collection or enforcement of an out-of-state   judgment where the amount due is within the monetary limits of the Special Civil   Part, you must file a complaint with an exemplified copy of the out-of-state   judgment attached with the Office of the Clerk in the county where the defendant   lives or is located.</p>
<p>SETTLEMENT</p>
<p>If a case is settled before trial, the plaintiff is responsible for filing a   stipulation of dismissal with the Special Civil Part. If a judgment is paid,   with or without the aid of a Court Officer, the plaintiff is responsible for   filing a warrant of satisfaction with the Special Civil Part</p>
