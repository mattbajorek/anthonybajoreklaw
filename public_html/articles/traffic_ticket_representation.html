<p>TRAFFIC REPRESENTATION AND NO POINTS</p>
<p>TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS 4 POINTS OR LESS N.J.S.A. 39:4-1-   WE GO TO COURT TO TRY   TO NEGOTIATE FOR   NEW &quot;NO POINT&quot; TICKET</p>
<p> Our office helps people with traffic/ municipal court tickets.  We provide   representation on  most Central New Jersey traffic cases.  Motor vehicle   violations and criminal charges can cost you.  If you plead guilty by mail or in   court for almost all traffic tickets, you will have to pay fines in court and   will later receive points on your drivers license.  Both the DMV and your car   insurance company will impose surcharges and eligibility points for three   years.</p>
<p> Under the New Jersey Court Rules, a New Jersey  Attorney can   negotiate with the Municipal Court Prosecutor to attempt to reduce points.</p>
<p> An accumulation of too many points, or certain moving violations may require   you to pay expensive surcharges to the N.J. Division of Motor Vehicles or have   your license suspended.  Dont give up!   We can appear in court for you on most   Central New Jersey   traffic violations.</p>
