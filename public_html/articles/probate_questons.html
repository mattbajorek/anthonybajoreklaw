<p>Probate is the process where after death the instructions of the Will are   carried out. Will is admitted to &ldquo;Probate&rdquo; in the County Surrogate. Some people   refer to the Surrogate as the Will Clerk. Upon the death of the testator or   testatrix (maker of the Will), the probate procedure can begin. This is the   legal process which establishes the genuineness of the Will. It is done by the   Surrogate in the county where the testator or testatrix resided at the time of   death.</p>
<p>The probate application must contain the following information:</p>
<p>1. the applicant's residence;?</p>
<p>2. the name, domicile and date of death of the decedent;?</p>
<p>3. the names and addresses of the decedent's spouse, heirs (those entitled to   take under the laws of interstate succession), and any person named to serve as   Executor;?</p>
<p>4. the ages of any minor heirs; and?</p>
<p>5. the names of the testator's children when the Will was made and the names   of children born and adopted after the Will was made, or their children, if   any.</p>
<p>To minimize time spent in the Surrogate, it is recommended, and in some   counties required, that before an Executor submits the Will for probate the   executor&rsquo;s attorney or executor send the Court:</p>
<p>1) a data sheet (referred to in some counties as an information sheet or a   fact sheet) containing the information needed by the Surrogate to complete the   application;</p>
<p>2) a copy of the Will; and</p>
<p>3) a copy of the death certificate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FILING A PROBATE APPLICATION Upon the death of a person, a probate proceeding   may be commenced by offering the decedent's (the dead person's ) last Will for   probate in the Surrogate's Court of the county in which the decedent was   domiciled at death. R. 4:80-1(a). Generally, the Executor nominated in the Will   brings the proceeding by filing a verified application with the Court.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the applicant files the original Will for probate, the applicant must   also file a death certificate (and original with a raised seal). A filing fee of   approximately $150 must be paid. Once the Will, application and death   certificate are filed, the Surrogate will review the papers, and if there are no   irregularities or objections, admit the Will to probate. Although New Jersey law   prohibits admission of a Will to probate within 10 days of the testator's death,   an applicant may submit the application prior to expiration of the 10-day   period. If the Will is filed after the 10-day waiting period, many Courts will   issue a judgment for probate contemporaneously with the filing of the probate   papers.</p>
<p>Qualifying the Executor</p>
<p>Once the Will is admitted to probate, the Court will issue letters   testamentary to an Executor who has properly qualified to serve. An Executor   named in a Will qualifies to serve by filing a form affidavit in which the   Executor agrees to perform his or her duties. The nominated Executor must also   provide a power of attorney to the Surrogate empowering the Surrogate to accept   service of process of claims against the estate. Once the Executor qualifies,   the Court then issues letters testamentary.</p>
<p>Mailing Probate Notices</p>
<p>After a Will is admitted to probate, the Executor&rsquo;s Attorney or Executor must   mail within 60 days a notice of probate to the decedent's spouse, heirs and all   beneficiaries under the Will. The notice of probate should contain the   executor's name and address, place and date that the Will was probated, and an   offer to furnish a copy of the Will upon request. Within 10 days of mailing the   notice the Executor&rsquo;s Attorney or Executor should file proof of service of the   notice with the Surrogate's Court. Once notice of probate has been sent and   proof of mailing has been filed the probate process is essentially   completed.</p>
<p>Completing the probate process should cause only minimal delay, perhaps a few   weeks, in administering a decedent's affairs. The cost of admitting a Will to   probate should be limited. Unlike in some other states, the Surrogate's filing   fee in New Jersey is the same regardless of the size of the estate. See Zimiles   Probate is not a Dirty word in New Jersey N.J. Lawyer pg. 14 ( July/August   1992)</p>
<p>How do I begin the probate procedure?</p>
<p>The Executor or personal representative can be appointed and the Will   admitted to probate in most cases by going to the Surrogate's Court with the   original Will, certified death certificate, and, if the Will is not self-proven,   at least one of the witnesses who signed the Will must prove the signature on   the Will.</p>
<p>How is an administrator appointed when there is no Will?</p>
<p>When there is no Will, an administrator, administratrix or personal   representative is appointed by the Surrogate's Court. The surviving spouse has   the first right to apply for the position of administrator; however, any heir of   the decedent may be appointed. When one of several heirs seeks to be appointed   administrator, all other heirs must renounce their right to be appointed   administrator. In most cases, a surety bond must be furnished to cover the value   of the real and personal property in the estate.</p>
<p>What kind of information should I collect?</p>
<p>The decedent's personal representative should make a list of all of the next   of kin of the person who died, along with their degree of relationship,   addresses and ages.</p>

Other property may be subject to a lien for unpaid   inheritance taxes such as bank accounts and certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>How about federal estate taxes?</p>
<p>In 2008 there is no federal tax due unless the estate exceeds $2,000,000.   However, there is a New Jersey Estate tax for estates over $675,000.</p>

<p>Where does the Executor/Administrator obtain the funds to pay debts?</p>

<p>Am I entitled to compensation for acting as Executor or Administrator?</p>
<p>An Executor or Administrator is entitled to corpus commissions of 5% of the   first $200,000.00 of estate assets subject to administration, 3-1/2% on the   excess over $200,000.00 up to $1,000,000.00 and 2% or such other percentage as   the Court may determine on the excess over $1,000,000.00.</p>
<p>If there is more than one Executor or Administrator, an additional 1% corpus   commission may be allowed by the Court for each additional Executor or   Administrator.</p>
<p>In addition to corpus commissions, an Executor or Administrator is entitled   to income commissions of 6% of income earned on estate corpus during the   administration of the estate.</p>
<p>What do I do about a safe deposit box in the name of the decedent ?</p>
<p>Individuals generally keep their Will in their safe deposit box. The personal   representative is permitted to remove the original Will, as well as a deed to a   cemetery plot and certain life insurance policies from the decedent's safe   deposit box before probate without a representative of the Inheritance Tax   Bureau present. Thereafter, the box is sealed until the District Supervisor of   the New jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Bureau opens and makes an inventory of   the contents of the box. It is the responsibility of the personal representative   to contact the District Supervisor of the county in which the box is located to   arrange for an appointment for this inventory.</p>
<p>How do I handle joint bank accounts or certificates of deposit?</p>
<p>Certain bank accounts and certificates may be owned with rights of   survivorship, which means that upon the death of one party to the account, the   surviving party (or parties) become the sole owner (or owners). If the decedent   maintained such an account, the survivor Will be able to withdraw on-half of the   funds in the account by giving the bank a Death Certificate and without the need   to provide anything from the Surrogate. The other half will not be released   until a tax waiver is issued by the New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Bureau,   normally after the tax is paid and the return is filed.</p>
<p>Is all this paperwork necessary even on small estates?</p>
<p>There is a procedure whereby the assets of small estates can be transferred   to the surviving spouse without the necessity of administration. The spouse   files an affidavit stating, among other things, that the decedent had no Will   and that all of the real and personal assets of the decedent do not exceed   $10,000.</p>
<p> </p>

The Refunding Bond is then   forwarded to the Surrogate for filing and recording.</p>
