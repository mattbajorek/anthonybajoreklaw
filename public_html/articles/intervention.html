<h1 align="center"><strong>Pre-trial Intervention</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC represents individuals charged with criminal and serious traffic violations   throughout New Jersey.</p>
<p>Under New Jersey Criminal Statute and Court Rules, someone charged with an   indictable criminal offense who has no prior indictable offenses can apply for   Pre-Trial Intervention (PTI).</p>
<p>This Statute permits someone under limited instances to have the prosecution   stopped and enter into a probation type program. If someone successfully   completes PTI, the indictable criminal charge is dismissed.</p>
<p>PTI is not available if the criminal offense is a disorderly person offense,   such as simple assault, harassment or shoplifting. For persons facing a first   offense possession of marijuana charge, they can apply for a Conditional   Discharge. NJSA 2C: 36-1. As a practical matter, in Municipal Courts, the   defense attorneys sometimes can work out an agreement with the complainant in a   municipal court criminal ticket to have the prosecution put on hold for six   months. If the defendant complies with a stipulated agreement, such as staying   away from the complainant, after 6 months the criminal charges are   dismissed.</p>
<p>It is imperative for someone facing criminal charges, whether indictable or   not, to immediately hire an experienced criminal attorney.</p>
<p>Do not rely on a real estate attorney to be familiar with recent cases   affecting PTI and criminal law.</p>
<p>PTI should be applied for immediately with Criminal Case Management. The   Court Rules have time limits for PTI application and appeals from denial of PTI.   Procedurally, once the accused applies for PTI, a decision to accept or reject   is made by the Criminal Case Manager.</p>
<p>If approved, then the County Prosecutors office must approve. Thereafter, the   Superior Court Judge assigned to the case must approve the defendant.</p>
<p>If the defendant is rejected by either the Criminal Case Manager or the   Prosecutor, a timely appeal must be filed with the Superior Court Judge.</p>
<p>In Practice, my law office has submitted letters of reference, proof of   employment, a resume and other supporting documents to the Criminal Case   Manager. Similar to sentencing, you want to provide any beneficial facts and   papers to demonstrate the defendant is a first time offender who is unlikely to   again be involved in a criminal case.</p>
<p>Similar to Probation following a guilty plea or conviction, the Court can   require the defendant to perform certain acts. Typical re-trial orders direct   the defendant to not get arrested, undergo drug and alcohol testing and   counseling, pay restitution or perform other acts.</p>
<p>Non-compliance will result in dismissal from PTI. Thereafter, the defendant   must face trial on all indictable charges.</p>
<p>CONDITIONAL DISCHARGE OF DRUG CHARGES IN MUNICIPAL COURT</p>
<p>The defense of a person charged with possession of drugs or drug   paraphernalia is a difficult but not impossible task for a defense. There are a   number of viable defenses, arguments and alternatives which can be pursued to   achieve a successful result. Advocacy, commitment, and persistence are essential   to an attorney defending a client accused of involvement with controlled   dangerous substances (CDS).</p>
<p>If the Suppression Motion is unsuccessful or not a viable option, counsel   should discuss the possibility of obtaining a Conditional Discharge.</p>
<p>Some people are charged with possession of small amounts of marijuana.   N.J.S.A. 2C:36A-1 provides that a person not previously convicted of a drug   offense either under Title 2C or Title 24 and who has not previously been   granted supervisory treatment under N.J.S.A. 24:21-27, 2C:43-12 or 2C:36A-1 may   apply for a conditional discharge.</p>
<p>The court upon notice to the prosecutor and subject to 2C:36A-1(c) may, on   the motion of the defendant or the court, suspend further proceedings and place   the defendant on supervisory treatment (i.e., probation,, supervised or   unsupervised attendance at Narcotics Anonymous, etc.). Since the granting of a   conditional discharge is optional with the court, defense counsel should be   prepared to prove, through letters, documents, or even witnesses, that the   defendants continued presence in the community or in a civil treatment program,   will not pose a danger to the community.</p>
<p>Defense counsel should be prepared to convince the court that the terms and   conditions of supervisory treatment will be adequate to protect the public and   will benefit the defendant by serving to correct any dependence on or use of   controlled substances. For applicable caselaw on conditional discharges, see   State v. Sanders, N.J. Super. 515 (App. Div. 1979), State v. Banks, 157 N.J.   Super. 442 (Law Div. 1978), State v. Grochulski, 133 N.J. Super. 586 (Law Div.   1975), State v. Teitelbaum, 160 N.J. Super. 450 (Law Div. 1978), State v.   DiLuzio, 130 N.J. Super. 220 (Law Div. 1974). The defendant must be required to   pay a $45.00 application fee, plus the mandatory $500.00 DEDR penalty. The court   further has the option to suspend a defendants drivers license for between six   months and two years.</p>
<p>The conditional discharge period is also between six months and two years. If   the defendant is convicted of a drug offense during the CD period or violates   the conditions set by the court, the prosecution resumes. The defendant may even   apply for a conditional discharge after he/she is found guilty, but before   sentence is imposed. If the CD is granted at this point in the proceeding, the 6   to 24 month license suspension is mandatory.</p>
<p>Drug related offenses carry substantial penalties which will effect a client   for the rest of his life. The space limits of this article do not allow detailed   explanation of the extensive caselaw on controlled dangerous substances. Members   of the Bar must accept the challenge and apply their legal talents to ensure   that the rights of their clients are protected.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Pre-trial intervention is an excellent opportunity for someone to avoid a   trial and conviction. If facing criminal charges, quickly sit down with a   criminal attorney to protect your rights. If accepted into Pre-Trial   Intervention, Motions to Suppress Evidence and other Motions are put on   hold.</p>
<p>PTI law:</p>
<p>2C:43-12. Supervisory treatment - pretrial intervention 2C:43-12. Supervisory   Treatment--Pretrial Intervention. a. Public policy. The purpose of sections   2C:43-12 through 2C:43-22 of this chapter is to effectuate a Statewide program   of Pretrial Intervention. It is the policy of the State of New Jersey that   supervisory treatment should ordinarily be limited to persons who have not   previously been convicted of any criminal offense under the laws of New Jersey,   or under any criminal law of the United States, or any other state when   supervisory treatment would:</p>
<p>(1) Provide applicants, on an equal basis, with opportunities to avoid   ordinary prosecution by receiving early rehabilitative services or supervision,   when such services or supervision can reasonably be expected to deter future   criminal behavior by an applicant, and when there is apparent causal connection   between the offense charged and the rehabilitative or supervisory need, without   which cause both the alleged offense and the need to prosecute might not have   occurred; or</p>
<p>(2) Provide an alternative to prosecution for applicants who might be harmed   by the imposition of criminal sanctions as presently administered, when such an   alternative can be expected to serve as sufficient sanction to deter criminal   conduct; or</p>
<p>(3) Provide a mechanism for permitting the least burdensome form of   prosecution possible for defendants charged with victimless offenses; or</p>
<p>(4) Provide assistance to criminal calendars in order to focus expenditure of   criminal justice resources on matters involving serious criminality and severe   correctional problems; or</p>
<p>(5) Provide deterrence of future criminal or disorderly behavior by an   applicant in a program of supervisory treatment.</p>
<p>b. Admission of an applicant into a program of supervisory treatment shall be   measured according to the applicants amenability to correction, responsiveness   to rehabilitation and the nature of the offense.</p>
<p>c. The decision and reasons therefor made by the designated judges (or   assignment judges), prosecutors and program directors in granting or denying   applications for supervisory treatment, in recommending and ordering termination   from the program or dismissal of charges, in all cases shall be reduced to   writing and disclosed to the applicant.</p>
<p>d. If an applicant desires to challenge the decision of the prosecutor or   program director not to recommend enrollment in a program of supervisory   treatment the proceedings prescribed under section 14 shall be followed.</p>
<p>e. Referral. At any time prior to trial but after the filing of a criminal   complaint, or the filing of an accusation or the return of an indictment, with   the consent of the prosecutor and upon written recommendation of the program   director, the assignment judge or a judge designated by him may postpone all   further proceedings against an applicant and refer said applicant to a program   of supervisory treatment approved by the Supreme Court. Prosecutors and program   directors shall consider in formulating their recommendation of an applicants   participation in a supervisory treatment program, among others, the following   criteria:</p>
<p>(1) The nature of the offense;</p>
<p>(2) The facts of the case;</p>
<p>(3) The motivation and age of the defendant;</p>
<p>(4) The desire of the complainant or victim to forego prosecution;</p>
<p>(5) The existence of personal problems and character traits which may be   related to the applicants crime and for which services are unavailable within   the criminal justice system, or which may be provided more effectively through   supervisory treatment and the probability that the causes of criminal behavior   can be controlled by proper treatment;</p>
<p>(6) The likelihood that the applicants crime is related to a condition or   situation that would be conducive to change through his participation in   supervisory treatment;</p>
<p>(7) The needs and interests of the victim and society;</p>
<p>(8) The extent to which the applicants crime constitutes part of a continuing   pattern of anti-social behavior;</p>
<p>(9) The applicants record of criminal and penal violations and the extent to   which he may present a substantial danger to others;</p>
<p>(10) Whether or not the crime is of an assaultive or violent nature, whether   in the criminal act itself or in the possible injurious consequences of such   behavior;</p>
<p>(11) Consideration of whether or not prosecution would exacerbate the social   problem that led to the applicants criminal act;</p>
<p>(12) The history of the use of physical violence toward others;</p>
<p>(13) Any involvement of the applicant with organized crime;</p>
<p>(14) Whether or not the crime is of such a nature that the value of   supervisory treatment would be outweighed by the public need for   prosecution;</p>
<p>(15) Whether or not the applicants involvement with other people in the crime   charged or in other crime is such that the interest of the State would be best   served by processing his case through traditional criminal justice system   procedures;</p>
<p>(16) Whether or not the applicants participation in pretrial intervention   will adversely affect the prosecution of codefendants; and</p>
<p>(17) Whether or not the harm done to society by abandoning criminal   prosecution would outweigh the benefits to society from channeling an offender   into a supervisory treatment program.</p>
<p>f. Review of Supervisory Treatment Applications; Procedure Upon Denial. Each   applicant for supervisory treatment shall be entitled to full and fair   consideration of his application. If an application is denied, the program   director or the prosecutor shall precisely state his findings and conclusion   which shall include the facts upon which the application is based and the   reasons offered for the denial. If the applicant desires to challenge the   decision of a program director not to recommend, or of a prosecutor not to   consent to, enrollment into a supervisory treatment program, a motion shall be   filed before the designated judge (or assignment judge) authorized pursuant to   the rules of court to enter orders.</p>
<p>g. Limitations. Supervisory treatment may occur only once with respect to any   defendant and any person who has previously received supervisory treatment under   section 27 of P.L.1970, c.226 (C.24:21-27), shall not be eligible for   supervisory treatment under this section. However, supervisory treatment, as   provided herein, shall be available to a defendant irrespective of whether the   defendant contests his guilt of the charge or charges against him.</p>
<p>h. Termination. Termination of supervisory treatment under this section shall   be immediately reported to the assignment judge of the county who shall forward   such information to the Administrative Director of the Courts.</p>
<p>i. Appointment of Program Directors; Authorized Referrals. Programs of   supervisory treatment and appointment of the program directors require approval   by the Supreme Court with the consent of the assignment judge and prosecutor.   Referrals of participants from supervisory treatment programs may be to any   public or private office or agency, including but not limited to, programs   within the probation service of the court, offering counseling or any other   social service likely to aid in the rehabilitation of the participant and to   deter the commission of other offenses.</p>
<p>j. Health Care Professional Licensing Board Notification. The program   director shall promptly notify the State Board of Medical Examiners when a State   licensed physician or podiatrist has been enrolled in a supervisory treatment   program after he has been charged with an offense involving drugs or   alcohol.</p>

<p>2C:43-13. Supervisory treatment procedure 2C:43-13. Supervisory Treatment   Procedure a. Agreement. The terms and duration of the supervisory treatment   shall be set forth in writing, signed by the prosecutor and agreed to and signed   by the participant. Payment of the assessment required by section 2 of P.L.1979,   c.396 (C.2C:43-3.1) shall be included as a term of the agreement. If the   participant is represented by counsel, defense counsel shall also sign the   agreement. Each order of supervisory treatment shall be filed with the county   clerk.</p>
<p>b. Charges. During a period of supervisory treatment the charge or charges on   which the participant is undergoing supervisory treatment shall be held in an   inactive status pending termination of the supervisory treatment pursuant to   subsection d. or e. of this section.</p>
<p>c. Period of treatment. Supervisory treatment may be for such period, as   determined by the designated judge or the assignment judge, not to exceed three   years, provided, however, that the period of supervisory treatment may be   shortened or terminated as the program director may determine with the consent   of the prosecutor and the approval of the court.</p>
<p>d. Dismissal. Upon completion of supervisory treatment, and with the consent   of the prosecutor, the complaint, indictment or accusation against the   participant may be dismissed with prejudice.</p>
<p>e. Violation of conditions. Upon violation of the conditions of supervisory   treatment, the court shall determine, after summary hearing, whether said   violation warrants the participants dismissal from the supervisory treatment   program or modification of the conditions of continued participation in that or   another supervisory treatment program. Upon dismissal of the participant from   the supervisory treatment program, the charges against the participant may be   reactivated and the prosecutor may proceed as though no supervisory treatment   had been commenced.</p>
<p>f. Evidence. No statement or other disclosure by a participant undergoing   supervisory treatment made or disclosed to the person designated to provide such   supervisory treatment shall be disclosed, at any time, to the prosecutor in   connection with the charge or charges against the participant, nor shall any   such statement or disclosure be admitted as evidence in any civil or criminal   proceeding against the participant. Nothing provided herein, however, shall   prevent the person providing supervisory treatment from informing the   prosecutor, or the court, upon request or otherwise as to whether or not the   participant is satisfactorily responding to supervisory treatment.</p>
<p>g. Delay. No participant agreeing to undergo supervisory treatment shall be   permitted to complain of a lack of speedy trial for any delay caused by the   commencement of supervisory treatment.</p>
<p>A person applying for admission to a program of supervisory treatment shall   pay to the court a fee of $75.00. The court shall forward all money collected   under this subsection to the treasurer of the county in which the court is   located. This money shall be used to defray the cost of juror compensation   within that county. A person may apply for a waiver of this fee, by reason of   poverty, pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey.   Of the moneys collected under this subsection, $30.00 of each application fee   shall be deposited in the temporary reserve fund created by section 25 of   P.L.1993, c.275. After December 31, 1994,the $75.00 fee shall be paid to the   court, for use by the State.</p>

<p>RULE 3:28. PRETRIAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMS</p>
<p>(a) Each Assignment Judge shall designate a judge or judges to act on all   matters pertaining to pretrial intervention programs in the vicinage in   accordance with N.J.S.A. 2C:43-12 and -13.</p>
<p>(b) Where a defendant charged with a penal or criminal offense has been   accepted by the program, the designated judge may, on the recommendation of the   criminal division manager and with the consent of the prosecutor and the   defendant, postpone all further proceedings against said defendant on such   charges for a period not to exceed thirty-six months.</p>
<p>(c) At the conclusion of the period set forth in paragraph (b) or earlier   upon motion of the criminal division manager, the designated judge shall make   one of the following dispositions:</p>
<p>(1) On recommendation of the criminal division manager and with the consent   of the prosecutor and the defendant, dismiss the complaint, indictment or   accusation against the defendant, such a dismissal to be designated matter   adjusted-complaint (or indictment or accusation) dismissed; or</p>
<p>(2) On recommendation of the criminal division manager and with the consent   of the prosecutor and the defendant, further postpone all proceedings against   such defendant on such charges for an additional period of time as long as the   aggregate of postponement periods under the rule does not exceed thirty-six   months; or</p>
<p>(3) On the written recommendation of the criminal division manager or the   prosecutor or on the courts own motion order the prosecution of the defendant to   proceed in the ordinary course. Where a recommendation for such an order is made   by the criminal division manager or the prosecutor, such person shall, before   submitting such recommendation to the designated judge, provide the defendant or   defendants attorney with a copy of such recommendation, shall advise the   defendant of the opportunity to be heard thereon, and the designated judge shall   afford the defendant such a hearing.</p>
<p>(4) During the conduct of hearings subsequent to an order returning the   defendant to prosecution in the ordinary course, no program records,   investigative reports, reports made for a court or prosecuting attorney, or   statements made by the defendant to program staff shall be admissible in   evidence against such defendant.</p>
<p>(5) No statement or other disclosure regarding the charge or charges against   the participant made or disclosed by a participant in pretrial intervention to a   person designated to provide supervisory treatment shall be disclosed by such   person at any time, to the prosecutor, nor shall any such statement or   disclosure be admitted as evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding against   the participant, provided that the criminal division manager shall not be   prevented from informing the prosecutor, or the court, on request or otherwise,   whether the participant is satisfactorily responding to supervisory   treatment.</p>
<p>(d) Where proceedings have been postponed against a defendant for an   additional period as provided in paragraph (c)(2), at the conclusion of such   period the designated judge may not again postpone proceedings but shall make a   disposition in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (3). The aggregate of   postponement periods under this rule shall in no case exceed thirty-six   months.</p>
<p>(e) The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish and maintain a   Pretrial Intervention Registry for the purpose of determining applications,   enrollments and the degree of completion thereof by a defendant in a program   approved by the Supreme Court in accordance with paragraph (a). The Pretrial   Intervention Registry shall contain such information and material as directed by   the Supreme Court. No order to expunge or seal records of arrest after dismissal   of a complaint, indictment or accusation under paragraph (c) or (d) shall bar   the retention of material and information in the Pretrial Intervention Registry   for the purposes of determining a defendants prior applications to, enrollments   in and the degree of completion of a Pretrial Intervention Program or for   statistical reports required of the Administrative Director of the Courts, by   law or the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>(f) When the criminal division manager and prosecutor reject an application   for participation in the pretrial intervention program, there shall be no   pretrial review by an appellate court if the rejection is upheld by the   designated judge or the Assignment Judge. An order enrolling a defendant into   the pretrial intervention program over the prosecutors objection shall be deemed   final for purposes of appeal, as of right, and shall be automatically stayed for   fifteen days following its entry and thereafter pending appellate review.</p>
<p>(g) Denial of acceptance pursuant to this rule may be reviewed on appeal from   a judgment of conviction notwithstanding that such judgment is entered following   a plea of guilty.</p>
<p>(h) Application for pretrial intervention shall be made at the earliest   possible opportunity, including before indictment, but in any event no later   than twenty-eight days after indictment. The criminal division manager shall   complete the evaluation and make a recommendation within twenty-five days of the   filing of the application. The prosecutor shall complete a review of the   application and inform the court and defendant within fourteen days of the   receipt of the criminal division managers recommendation.</p>
<p>An appeal by the defendant shall be made on motion to the Presiding Judge of   the Criminal Division or to the judge to whom the case has been assigned within   ten days after the rejection and shall be made returnable at the next status   conference or at such time as the judge determines will promote an expeditious   disposition of the case.</p>
<p>Where application is made pre-indictment, the prosecutor may withhold action   on the application until the matter has been presented to the grand jury.</p>
<p><br />
  Guideline 1</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The purposes of pretrial intervention are:<br />
  (a) To provide defendants with   opportunities to avoid ordinary prosecution by receiving early rehabilitative   services, when such services can reasonably be expected to deter future criminal   behavior by the defendant, and when there is an apparent causal connection   between the offense charged and the rehabilitative need, without which cause   both the alleged offense and the need to prosecute might not have   occurred.<br />
  (b) To provide an alternative to prosecution for defendants who   might be harmed by the imposition of criminal sanctions as presently   administered, when such an alternative can be expected to serve as sufficient   sanction to deter criminal conduct.<br />
  (c) To provide a mechanism for permitting   the least burdensome form of prosecution possible for defendants charged with   victimless offenses.<br />
  (d) To assist in the relief of presently overburdened   criminal calendars in order to focus expenditure of criminal justice resources   on matters involving serious criminality and severe correctional   problems.<br />
  (e) To deter future criminal or disorderly behavior by a   defendant/participant in pretrial intervention.</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Guideline 1(a) states a rehabilitative model on which PTI programs in New   Jersey are based. The rehabilitative model emphasizes that social, cultural and   economic conditions often result in a defendants choice of environmental   compulsion to commit crime. PTI seeks to solve personal problems which tend to   result from the conditions that appear to cause crime.<br />
  Guideline 1(b)   recognizes that diversion in appropriate circumstances can serve as sufficient   sanction to deter future criminal conduct.<br />
  Guideline 1(c) provides for the   use of PTI as a mechanism for minimizing penetration into the criminal process   for broad categories of offenders accused of victimless crimes, without   relinquishing criminal justice control over such persons while statutes   proscriptive of such behavior remain in force.<br />
  Guideline 1(d) provides for   removing from ordinary prosecution those who can be deterred from criminal   behavior by short term rehabilitative work or supervision. It is to be   emphasized that the potential for rehabilitation must be considered in light of   the time periods embodied in Rule 3:28(b), (c), (d).<br />
  The deterrence of   criminal behavior in many cases requires intensive work: counseling,   psychotherapy, drug-abuse prevention and control, employment placement. Programs   in these cases should be measured against available treatment facilities and the   time constraints of PTI. For other defendants, however, no more than a   supervised pretrial probationary period may be necessary when no extensive need   for rehabilitative services can be discerned.<br />
  Guideline 1(e) acknowledges   that pre-conviction rehabilitation can be in the public interest when it results   in the deterrence of future misconduct.</p>
<p>Guideline 2</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Eligibility for PTI is broad enough to include all defendants who demonstrate   sufficient effort to effect necessary behavioral change and show that future   criminal behavior will not occur. Any defendant accused of crime shall be   eligible for admission into a PTI program. When the application indicates   factors which would ordinarily lead to exclusion under the guidelines   established hereinafter, the applicant nevertheless shall have the opportunity   to present to the criminal division manager, and through the criminal division   manager to the prosecutor, any facts or materials demonstrating the defendants   amenability to the rehabilitative process, showing compelling reasons justifying   the defendants admission, and establishing that a decision against enrollment   would be arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Guideline 2 provides that each applicant for a PTI program is entitled to   full and fair consideration of his or her application. When the application   indicates factors that cause either the criminal division manager to reject the   application or the prosecutor to deny consent to an enrollment, a statement   particularizing the reasons for the rejection or the withholding of consent by   the prosecutor must be furnished to the defendant. If the defendant wishes to   challenge a rejection by the criminal division manager, or the prosecutors   denial of consent to enrollment, the defendant may do so in accordance with the   procedures set forth in guidelines 6 and 8. It is the duty of the applicant to   allege and present any facts and materials to the criminal division manager for   reconsideration either by the criminal division manager or prosecutor, if the   prosecutor has denied consent, showing compelling reasons justifying admission,   and establishing that a decision against enrollment would be arbitrary and   unreasonable. The presentation of this material should be done concurrently with   the filing of a motion under guideline 8 for review of a decision by a criminal   division manager not to recommend or of a prosecutor not to consent to   enrollment.</p>
<p>Guideline 3</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In evaluating a defendants application for participation in a pretrial   intervention program, consideration shall be given to the criteria set forth in   N.J.S.A. 2C:43-12(e). In addition thereto, the following factors shall also be   considered together with other relevant circumstances:<br />
  (a) Age. Pretrial   intervention is designed to deal only with adult defendants who, in accordance   with New Jersey law, are those persons above the age of 18. Also included are   those juveniles between the ages of 16 and 18 who are treated as adults under R.   5:9-5.<br />
  (b) Residence. New Jerseys PTI program is designed to deal with the   problem of crime in New Jersey. Only those defendants are ineligible who reside   such distances from New Jersey as to bar effective counseling or supervisory   procedures.<br />
  (c) Jurisdiction. Only defendants charged with criminal or penal   offenses in the criminal or municipal courts of the State of New Jersey may be   enrolled pursuant to R. 3:28.<br />
  (d) Minor Violations. Defendants should not be   eligible for enrollment if the likely disposition would result in a suspended   sentence without probation or a fine. Those charged with ordinance, health code   and other similar violations are not eligible.<br />
  (e) Prior Record of   Convictions. While the pretrial intervention program is not limited to first   offenders, defendants who have been previously convicted of a criminal offense   should ordinarily be excluded. Such defendants who have at any prior time been   convicted of a first or second degree crime or who irrespective of the degree of   the crime have completed a term of probation, incarceration or parole within   five years prior to the date of application for diversion shall ordinarily not   be considered for enrollment in PTI except on joint application by the defendant   and the prosecutor. Defendants charged with more than one offense may be   considered for enrollment.<br />
  (f) Parolees and Probationers. Defendants who, at   the time of arrest, are probationers or parolees should be considered for   enrollment under R. 3:28 only after consultation with the Chief Probation   Officer or District Parole Supervisor whose departments supervise the   defendants, and only after they have agreed that revocation of probation or   parole need not be recommended or after the appropriate authority has made the   decision not to revoke probation or parole.<br />
  (g) Defendants Previously   Diverted. Supervisory treatment may occur only once with respect to any   defendant who has previously been enrolled in a program of pretrial intervention   or conditionally discharged pursuant to N.J.S.A. 24:21-27 or N.J.S.A. 2C:36A-1.   All applications for enrollment in a PTI program must proceed in accordance with   the rules of the Supreme Court and these guidelines after reference to the   Pretrial Intervention Registry established pursuant to R. 3:28(e) and N.J.S.A.   2C:43-21(a). No order to expunge or seal records of arrest after dismissal of a   complaint, indictment or accusation under paragraph (c) or (d) shall bar the   retention of material and information in the Pretrial Intervention Registry for   the purposes of determining a defendants prior applications to, enrollments in,   and the degree of completion of a Pretrial Intervention Program or for   statistical reports required of the Administrative Director of the Courts, by   law or the Supreme Court.<br />
  (h) Eligibility Under N.J.S.A. 24:21-27 or N.J.S.A.   2C:36A-1. The statutes set forth the criteria for eligibility and guidelines for   exclusion. Defendants eligible for pretrial intervention or conditional   discharge pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:36A-1 or § 27 of the Controlled Dangerous   Substances Act may be placed under the supervision of a pretrial intervention   program.<br />
  (i) Assessment of the Nature of the Offense. Any defendant charged   with crime is eligible for enrollment in a PTI program, but the nature of the   offense is a factor to be considered in reviewing the application. If the crime   was (1) part of organized criminal activity; or (2) part of a continuing   criminal business or enterprise; or (3) deliberately committed with violence or   threat of violence against another person; or (4) a breach of the public trust   where admission to a PTI program would deprecate the seriousness of defendants   crime, the defendants application should generally be rejected. A defendant   charged with a first or second degree offense or sale or dispensing of Schedule   I or II narcotic drugs as defined in L.1970, c. 226 (N.J.S.A. 24:21-1 et seq.)   by persons not drug dependent, should ordinarily not be considered for   enrollment in a PTI program except on joint application by the defendant and the   prosecutor. However, in such cases, the applicant shall have the opportunity to   present to the criminal division manager, and through the criminal division   manager to the prosecutor, any facts or materials demonstrating the applicants   amenability to the rehabilitative process, showing compelling reasons justifying   the applicants admission and establishing that a decision against enrollment   would be arbitrary and unreasonable.<br />
  (j) Co-defendants. The impact of   diversion on the prosecution of co-defendants is a factor to be   considered.<br />
  (k) Restitution and Community Service. A restitution or community   service requirement, or both, may be included as part of an individuals service   plan when such a requirement promises to aid the rehabilitation of the offender.   Any such requirement and its terms shall be judicially determined at the time of   enrollment following recommendation by the criminal division manager and consent   by the Prosecutor. Evidence of the restitution condition is not admissible   against defendant in any subsequent civil or criminal proceeding. Admission to   the program shall not be denied solely on the basis of anticipated inability to   meet a restitution requirement. Where appropriate to further rehabilitation,   symbolic or partial restitution may be included in the service.</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Guideline 3, in its introductory statement, requires that the statutory   criteria of N.J.S.A. 2C:43-12(e) be considered in the evaluation of a defendants   application for pretrial intervention. That statutory provision requires   consideration of those criteria among others. Accordingly, the original criteria   of this guideline have also been retained as explanatory of and supplemental to   the statutory criteria. For convenience in reference, the statutory criteria are   as follows:<br />
  (1) The nature of the offense;<br />
  (2) The facts of the   case;<br />
  (3) The motivation and age of the defendant;<br />
  (4) The desire of the   complainant or victim to forego prosecution;<br />
  (5) The existence of personal   problems and character traits which may be related to the applicants crime and   for which services are unavailable within the criminal justice system, or which   may be provided more effectively through supervisory treatment and the   probability that the causes of criminal behavior can be controlled by proper   treatment;<br />
  (6) The likelihood that the applicants crime is related to a   condition or situation that would be conducive to change through his   participation in supervisory treatment;<br />
  (7) The needs and interests of the   victim and society;<br />
  (8) The extent to which the applicants crime constitutes   part of a continuing pattern of anti-social behavior;<br />
  (9) The applicants   record of criminal and penal violations and the extent to which he may present a   substantial danger to others;<br />
  (10) Whether or not the crime is of an   assaultive or violent nature, whether in the criminal act itself or in the   possible injurious consequences of such behavior;<br />
  (11) Consideration of   whether or not prosecution would exacerbate the social problem that led to the   applicants criminal act;<br />
  (12) The history of the use of physical violence   toward others;<br />
  (13) Any involvement of the applicant with organized   crime;<br />
  (14) Whether or not the crime is of such a nature that the value of   supervisory treatment would be outweighed by the public need for   prosecution;</p>
<p>(15) Whether or not the applicants involvement with other people in the crime   charged or in other crime is such that the interest of the State would be best   served by processing his case through traditional criminal justice system   procedures;<br />
  (16) Whether or not applicants participation in pretrial   intervention will adversely affect the prosecution of co-defendants; and<br />
  (17)   Whether or not the harm done to society by abandoning criminal prosecution would   outweigh the benefits to society from channeling an offender into a supervisory   treatment program.<br />
  Guideline 3(a) indicates that the services of PTI programs   may, in appropriate instances and at the request of juvenile authorities and   programs, be made available to juvenile defendants when the need for   inter-program cooperative work is indicated.<br />
  Under Guideline 3(b), residents   of other States, charged with offenses in New Jersey counties in which there   exist pretrial intervention programs may, with the approval of the prosecuting   attorney, the designated judge, and Administrative Office of the Courts, be   permitted to participate in such out-of-state program while enrolled pursuant to   R. 3:28.<br />
  Regardless of the New Jersey jurisdiction in which the complaint,   indictment or accusation has been filed, defendants or participants may, with   the agreement of the PTI coordinators involved, be transferred for participation   among the various county or vicinage programs.<br />
  Guideline 3(c) establishes   jurisdictional requirements. However, defendants charged in other States or in   the Federal Courts, may in appropriate instances and with the permission of the   Administrative Office of the Court, be permitted to participate in the   counseling or supervision regimes of the county or vicinage PTI programs on   request of the Federal Authorities or a PTI program in another   State.<br />
  Guideline 3(d) sets forth the policy that those charged with minor   violations should not be admitted to a PTI program. It is felt that while no per   se exclusion of non-indictable offenses is appropriate, the PTI process is not   appropriate for such cases which do not involve a potential sentence of   consequence. Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt, 58 N.J. 281, 277 A.2d 216   (1971).1<br />
  Guideline 3(e) makes it clear that a prior criminal record may be   indicative of a behavioral pattern not conducive to short term rehabilitation.   Therefore, pretrial intervention should ordinarily be limited to persons who   have not previously been convicted of a crime and hence a rebuttable presumption   against enrollment is created by the fact of a prior conviction. An even heavier   onus is placed upon defendants whose prior conviction is of a first or second   degree crime or who have completed a term of imprisonment, probation or parole   within the five-year period immediately preceding the application for diversion.   As to those defendants, admission to the program is ordinarily dependent upon   the prosecutor joining in the PTI application.</p>
<p>Guideline 3(f) sets forth a policy permitting probationers and parolees to   enter PTI programs. Since the parolee/probationer is under the supervision of   the District Parole Supervisor or Chief Probation Officer, consultation should   be sought prior to recommending enrollment of the defendant into a PTI   program.<br />
  Guideline 3(g) creates a bar against admission into a PTI program   for those defendants who have previously been diverted under N.J.S.A. 2C:43-12   et seq. or conditionally discharged pursuant to N.J.S.A. 24:21-27 or N.J.S.A.   2C:36A-1. The Pretrial Intervention Registry established pursuant to N.J.S.A.   2C:43-21(a) and R. 3:28 serves as the means of identifying defendants previously   diverted through a PTI program. This registry is designed to complement the   Controlled Dangerous Substance Registry Act of 1970, pursuant to N.J.S.A.   26:2G-17 et seq.<br />
  Guideline 3(h) deems it appropriate that PTI programs may   assume the supervision of N.J.S.A. 24:21-27 or N.J.S.A. 2C:36A-1   cases.<br />
  Guideline 3(i) recognizes that consistent with State v. Leonardis, 71   N.J. 85, 363 A.2d 321 (1976) and 73 N.J. 360, 375 A.2d 607 (1977), there must be   a balance struck between a defendants amenability to correction, responsiveness   to rehabilitation and the nature of the offense. It is to be emphasized that   while all persons are eligible for pretrial intervention programs, those charged   with offenses encompassed within certain enumerated categories must bear the   burden of presenting compelling facts and materials justifying admission. First   and second degree crimes (and their Title 2A cognates) and the sale or   dispensing of Schedule I and II narcotics by persons not drug dependent are   specific categories of offenses that establish a rebuttable presumption against   admission of defendants into a PTI program. This presumption reflects the public   policy of PTI. PTI programs should ordinarily reject applications by defendants   who fall within these categories unless the prosecutor has affirmatively joined   in the application. A heavy burden rests with the defendant to present to the   criminal division manager at the time of application (a) proof that the   prosecutor has joined in the application and (b) any material that would   otherwise rebut the presumption against enrollment. When a defendant charged   with a first or second degree crime or the sale or dispensing of Schedule I or   II narcotics has been rejected because the prosecutor refuses to consent to the   filing of the application, or because in the sound discretion of the criminal   division manager the defendant has not rebutted the presumption against   admission, the burden lies with the defendant upon appeal to the court to show   that the prosecutor or criminal division manager abused such discretion. When an   application is rejected because the defendant is charged with a crime of the   first or second degree or sale or dispensing of Schedule I or II narcotics, and   the prosecutor refuses to join affirmatively in the filing of an application or   later refuses to consent to enrollment, such refusal should create a rebuttable   presumption against enrollment.<br />
  Guideline 3(k) recognizes that the use of   restitution and community service may play an integral role in rehabilitation.   Requiring either is strongly consonant with the individual approach defined in   State v. Leonardis, 71 N.J. 85, 363 A.2d 321 (1976) and 73 N.J. 360, 375 A.2d   607 (1977), which emphasized the needs of the offender. In determining the   restitution requirement and its terms including ability of the offender to pay,   the Court should rely on the procedures outlined in State in Interest of DGW, 70   N.J. 488, 361 A.2d 513 (1976) and State v. Harris, 70 N.J. 586 (1976).<br />
  Full   restitution need not be completed during participation in the program. In   determining whether a restitution requirement has been fulfilled, the designated   judge shall consider good-faith efforts by the defendant. In appropriate cases,   at the conclusion of participation, a civil judgment by confession may be   entered by the court. However, restitution should never be used in PTI for the   sole purpose of collecting monies for victims.</p>
<p>Guideline 4</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Enrollment in PTI programs should be conditioned upon neither informal   admission nor entry of a plea of guilty. Enrollment of defendants who maintain   their innocence should be permitted unless the defendants attitude would render   pretrial intervention ineffective.</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A PTI program is presented to defendants as an opportunity to earn a   dismissal of charges for social reasons and reasons of present and future   behavior, legal guilt or innocence notwithstanding. This stance produces a   relation of trust between counselor and defendant. Within the context of   pretrial intervention when and whether guilt should be admitted is a decision   for counselors. Counselors should be free to handle each case individually   according to their best judgment.<br />
  Neither admission of guilt nor   acknowledgment of responsibility is required. Steps to bar participation solely   on such grounds would be an unwarranted discrimination.<br />
  Nevertheless, many   guilty defendants blame their behavior on society, family, friends or   circumstance, and avoid recognition of the extent of their own role and   responsibility. While such an attitude continues, it is unlikely that behavioral   change can occur as a result of short-term rehabilitative work. An understanding   and acceptance of responsibility for behavior achieved through counseling, can   and often does, result in the beginnings of the defendants ability to control   his/her acts and is an indication that rehabilitation may, in large measure,   have been achieved.</p>
<p>Guideline 5</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Effective operation of pretrial intervention programs requires that a   relationship of confidence and trust be initiated and maintained between   participating defendants and staff. No information, therefore, obtained as a   result of a defendants application to or participation in a pretrial   intervention program should be used, in any subsequent proceeding, against his   or her advantage.</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>That a relationship based on trust is necessary for the   rehabilitation/attitude change process to operate cannot seriously be doubted,   and the policy reflected in the admissibility and defendant protection   provisions of R. 3:28 and R. 1:38 recognizes such a need. The priority of the   maintenance of the counselor-participant relation over the need for disclosures   resulting from this relationship is the same, of course, as the priority for the   maintenance of, for example, the confidentiality of lawyer-client,   physician/psychologist-patient communications. (Counselors should feel free to   shroud their association in an air of confidentiality. Use of information   gathered in this process would most likely be barred from future proceedings as   contrary to basic standards of due process and fundamental fairness. See In the   Interest of J.P.B., 143 N.J. Super. 96, 362 A.2d 1183 (App. Div. 1976). Of   course, defendants who give false information on PTI applications may subject   themselves to charges of perjury or false swearing in instances where supporting   affidavits may be required by the criminal division manager. Affidavits relating   to the facts and circumstances of the underlying offense shall not be   required.)<br />
  The essential PTI format is to give participating defendants a   true second chance to accomplish rehabilitation or to show otherwise that   criminal conduct is not likely to occur in the future; and if the defendant   fails in this effort, to return him or her to that stage of ordinary prosecution   at which proceedings had been stopped under R. 3:28, and to the extent possible,   enable prosecution to take place as if such defendants had not participated in   the PTI program so that defendants will not be prejudiced by an unsuccessful   attempt to earn a R. 3:28 dismissal.</p>
<p>Guideline 6</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Application for PTI should be made as soon as possible after commencement of   proceedings, but, where an indictable offense is charged, not later than 28 days   after indictment. All applications for PTI should be processed in the order of   their filing. However, where the application is filed after an indictment has   been returned, the PTI Program should complete its evaluation and make its   recommendation thereon within 25 days after filing. The prosecutor should   complete a review and advise the defendant within 14 days thereafter. An appeal   by defendant to the trial court shall be brought within 10 days after the   rejection notice and should be determined either before or at the pretrial   conference.</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>To relieve defendants from the anxiety of facing prosecution, to apply   appropriate rehabilitative measures at an early date, and to effect savings in   criminal justice resources, PTI programs should endeavor to divert qualified   defendants from the ordinary course of prosecution as soon as possible after the   filing of a complaint. The court must advise defendant of the opportunity to be   considered for PTI at the first appearance before the court. See R. 3:4-2. While   a PTI application should be made before indictment, there are nevertheless   problems involved in securing public defender counsel before arraignment. Thus,   while pre-indictment filing is encouraged, the application may be made no later   than 28 days after indictment, but not thereafter. This time requirement should   permit all defendants sufficient opportunity to make a voluntary and informed   choice concerning enrollment in a PTI program.<br />
  The time requirements set   forth in the guidelines for evaluation, recommendation and review are intended   to enable complete processing of a defendants application before the pretrial   conference. See R. 3:9-1e. Early filing as encouraged by this guideline, will   afford PTI programs and prosecutors the opportunity to manage their resources   better by providing them sufficient time to make informed evaluations. The time   limits for processing applications are designed to facilitate speedy trials and   are realistic in view of the limited scope of review following rejection.</p>
<p>Guideline 7</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Where application is made in an indictable offense, the prosecutor may   withhold action on the application until the matter has been presented to the   grand jury.</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Guideline 7 recognizes that at times it may be in the public interest to have   a particular defendant screened out of the criminal justice system, either by   administrative decision or grand jury action, rather than diverted into a PTI   program. Thus, the prosecutor is given the discretion to choose an appropriate   route and the court will not be burdened by hearing challenges if no indictment   is to be returned. However, the option of delaying action until the grand jury   has voted on the case should be considered only in rare instances. Generally,   expeditious handling of PTI applications is in consonance with the purpose of   diversion. Of course, if the prosecutor consents to the application, enrollment   into a PTI program should not be delayed and the defendant should generally be   enrolled before indictment.</p>
<p>Guideline 8</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The decisions and reasons therefor made by the designated judges (or   Assignment Judges), prosecutors and criminal division managers in granting or   denying defendants applications for PTI enrollment, in recommending and ordering   termination from the program or dismissal of charges, in all cases must be   reduced to writing and disclosed to defendant.<br />
  A defendant may be accepted   into a PTI program by the designated judge (or the Assignment Judge) on   recommendation of the criminal division manager, and with the consent of the   prosecuting attorney and the defendant. Applications that are recommended for   enrollment by the criminal division manager and consented to by the prosecutor   must be presented to the designated judge (or Assignment Judge) authorized to   enter orders. If a defendant desires to challenge the decision of a criminal   division manager not to recommend enrollment or of a prosecutor refusing to   consent to enrollment into a PTI program, a motion must be filed before the   designated judge (or the Assignment Judge) authorized to enter orders under R.   3:28. The challenge is to be based upon alleged arbitrary or capricious action,   and the defendant has the burden of showing that the criminal division manager   or prosecutor abused discretion in processing the application. No direct appeal   can be filed to the Appellate Division challenging the actions of the criminal   division manager or the prosecutor. The decision of the criminal division   manager or prosecutor may be challenged at a hearing on defendants motion before   the designated judge (or Assignment Judge) and, thereafter, defendant or   prosecutor can seek leave to appeal from the courts decision denying or   permitting enrollment.<br />
  A defendant shall also be entitled to a hearing   challenging a criminal division manager or prosecutors recommendation (following   an initial or subsequent adjournment under Rule 3:28) that the prosecution of   defendant proceed in the normal course. The decision of the court shall be   appealable by the defendant or the prosecutor as in the case of any   interlocutory order.<br />
  A defendant aggrieved by the decision of the designated   judge or assignment judge respecting the joint decision of the criminal division   manager and prosecutor to deny an application for participation in a pretrial   intervention program may not seek appellate review thereof until after entry of   judgment of conviction. A defendant may then seek such review even if the   judgment was entered following a plea of guilty. However, a prosecutor whose   denial of consent has been reversed by the designated judge or assignment judge   may seek leave to appeal pursuant to R. 2:2.</p>
<p>Guidelines 2, 3, 6 and 8 and Comments to Guidelines 2, 3, 5 and 6 amended   July 13, 1994 to be effective January 1, 1995; Guidelines 3(g) and (h) and   Comments to Guidelines 3(g) and (h) amended June 28, 1996 to be effective   September 1, 1996.</p>
<p>1 Of course all defendants charged with an indictable offense are eligible   for PTI.</p>
