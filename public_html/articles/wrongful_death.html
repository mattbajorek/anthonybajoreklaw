<p>In a Wrongful death jury trial in New Jersey, we [ your trial attorney] will   research the current caselaw.</p>
<p>The plaintiff brings this lawsuit as the representative of the survivors of   the decedent and seeks to recover damages from the defendant contending that   defendant's fault was responsible for the death of the decedent. The money   damages sought on behalf of the survivors of the decedent represent the actual   pecuniary or financial loss which plaintiff contends has been and will in the   future be suffered by the survivors due to the death of the decedent. This claim   for pecuniary or financial loss is distinguished from any physical injuries or   suffering that may have been sustained by the decedent, such as any pain and   suffering or disability sustained by the decedent. In the event that you find in   favor of the plaintiff, that is, that the defendant was at fault, which fault   was a proximate cause of plaintiff decedent's death, you must limit your   consideration to whatever financial loss was suffered by the survivors as   measured by what they would have received from the decedent within a reasonable   degree of probability if the decedent had survived. I instruct you that the   pecuniary injuries or money losses in this case should not include emotional   distress, anguish, grief and sorrow or loss of emotional satisfaction derived   from the society and companionship of the decedent. These matters, though real   and very distressing, cannot be considered in determining the extent of the   financial or pecuniary loss suffered by the survivors who are represented in   this action by the plaintiff. The financial loss does include, however, not only   actual monies which would have been contributed to or earned for the benefit of   the survivors, but it also includes the reasonable value of benefits which would   have been received in the nature of services, assistance and care as well as   training, guidance and counsel that the decedent's survivors (such as children,   parents or spouse) would have received had the decedent lived. To determine the   amount of damages to be awarded, i.e., the extent of the financial loss caused   by the premature death of the decedent, all circumstances and probabilities   which bear upon that financial loss may be considered. The following are factors   that you may weigh: 1. You may consider the age and general state of health of   the decedent and of the survivors. [You will recall that there was testimony   concerning their life expectancies as of the date of the decedent's death (and   the decedent's work life expectancy). These figures are in evidence and are   assumptions based on probable length of life which have been computed from   statistical data. They are general rules and you should therefore use them with   caution in any individual case. Except for this incident the decedent might have   lived much longer than estimated by the actuarial period of time. You should   consider the expectancy figures in your determination of damages, if any, to be   awarded for financial losses in accordance with my instructions in this case,   but you must exercise your sound judgment in computing them. Do not treat them   as a necessary or fixed rule.]See footnote 1 2. You should consider the net   earnings of the decedent after taxes as of the time of his/her death. You should   give due regard to any evidence concerning [the decedent's income tax liability   and you should also consider]See footnote 2 the decedent's potential future net   income during the balance of his/her working life expectancy. The reason for   considering net income is that only that portion of his/her income after taxes,   not gross income, would have been available for the benefit of the decedent's   survivors who are represented by the plaintiff in this case.</p>
<p>[Add where decedent is a minor child:</p>
<p>In this case, since the decedent is a minor child, you, the jury, should   consider the value of the reasonably anticipated direct financial contributions   which would have been made by the child to the survivors after he/she became a   wage earner. You should also take into consideration any actual financial   contributions, if any, which the decedent, while living, may have made to the   survivors in determining the pecuniary loss to them. ] 3. You should also   consider the decedent's own personal expenses. Therefore, it is necessary that   you find to what extent the net earnings of the decedent were necessary for   his/her own use, maintenance and personal needs. In determining the pecuniary   loss of the survivors there must be deducted from the net earnings of the   decedent whatever sums fairly represent expenses for his/her own maintenance   since it is obvious that these monies could not have been used for the benefit   of the survivors. 4. You may also consider the benefit given by the decedent to   a survivor or survivors in the form or services or assistance rendered by the   decedent and in guidance and training which may have been offered by the   decedent to the survivors. You must determine the reasonable value to be placed   on the services or benefits that will be lost by reason of the death of the   decedent.</p>
<p>[Add where decedent is a minor child:</p>
<p>In this case, since the decedent is a minor child, your assessment of damages   for the loss of services and assistance may be somewhat complicated, so let me   elaborate on this point further. In addition to the loss of anticipated direct   financial contributions from the decedent to the survivors which I noted   previously, you, the jury, should also consider the pecuniary value of the loss   of the child's anticipated services to the survivors, such as household chores   and baby-sitting for younger siblings, for example. You should also consider the   value of the parents' [or other survivors, where applicable] loss of the child's   care, companionship, advice and guidance as they grow older. You must remember,   however, that your award for damages for these losses will be confined to their   pecuniary value, excluding emotional loss. With respect to companionship, care,   and advice you must initially distinguish between their emotional value and   their pecuniary, or economic, value. We recognize that children may prove   valuable services such as companionship, care, advise and guidance over time as   the parents face advanced age or declining health.</p>
<p>Care and companionship, lost by death, to be compensable must be that which   would have provided services substantially similar to those provided by the   &quot;companions&quot; or &quot;homemakers&quot; often hired today by the aged or the infirm, or   substantially equivalent to services provided by nurses or practical nurses.   [Companionship in this sense, however, will not include true nursing services   unless the decedent had or was likely to have special training.] The value of   these services must be confined to what the marketplace would pay a stranger   with similar qualifications for performing such services. [In interpreting the   criteria or &quot;similar qualifications&quot; you may also attach a pecuniary value to   the knowledge of the parents' likes, dislikes and habits which the decedent may   have possessed.] Remember, however, that no pecuniary value may be attached to   the emotional satisfaction gained by the parent when the child performs these   services.) The loss of the decedent's guidance, advice and counsel to the   survivors is likewise to be confined to its pecuniary element. It is not the   loss simply of the exchange of views, no matter how perceptive, when the child   and parent (or other survivor, where appropriate) are together; it is certainly   not the loss of pleasure which accompanies such an exchange. Rather, it is the   loss of guidance, advice and counsel which all of us need from time to time in   particular situations, for specific purposes, perhaps as an aid in making a   business decision, or a decision affecting one's life generally, or even advice   and counsel needed to relieve depression or personal dilemmas. It must be the   kind of advice and guidance that could be purchased from a business advisor, a   therapist, or a trained counselor, for instance. Now, taking the foregoing   principles into consideration, it is up to you, the jury, to decide what   services the decedent would have rendered to the survivors, and what the value   of these services is. In doing so, remember that there need be no proof that the   parents (or other survivors, where appropriate) will probably purchase such   companionship and advice; it is sufficient that the deceased would have rendered   them if he/she had lived. 5. In considering those various factors, and in   ascertaining the probabilities of pecuniary loss, you should also consider the   decedent's personality and character, his/her habits and customs and the   relationship that existed between the decedent and the survivors. If you find   that plaintiff is entitled to an award, the amount that is recoverable is   comprised of two parts: (a) the amount of the loss to date; and (b) the present   value of future financial loss.</p>
<p>However, you will announce your verdict in one lump sum of money totaling   these two parts. The first thing that you must determine, once you have decided   that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, is the amount of the financial loss   from the date of death to the present date. To do this you must agree on an   amount which will represent the loss sustained by the survivors each year, and   simply add these amounts for each year elapsed since the date of decedent's   death to the present time. The next determination you must make is the present   value of the loss that may reasonably be anticipated from this time on into the   future. This computation is a little more complicated. In arriving at such   present value of future loss, it would be improper to take the amount of loss,   such as a certain number of dollars per year, and simply multiply that amount by   the number of years which you find constitutes the time that the decedent would   have continued to contribute to the survivors. The reason for this is that if   plaintiff is entitled to an award, the survivors will receive their award of   damages in one lump sum, whereas, had the decedent lived, the financial   contribution to the survivors would have been spread over a period of time. A   sum of money due at some future time is worth less today because, if paid today   in a lump sum rather than in installments, the lump sum received today can be   invested to earn interest. For example, if you were to determine that the amount   of survivor's yearly loss was $100 and that this loss would extend over a period   of 10 years and then you simply multiplied $100 x 10, your award of $1,000 would   be too much. This is so because the lump sum awarded now can be invested and   produce interest income. Such an award, therefore, would have a greater value   than just $100 a year. It would have a value of $100 a year plus the interest.   Therefore, if you were to make an award (merely by multiplying $100 x 10 years),   the survivors would receive more than their actual loss, or $1,000 plus the   interest it would earn. For this reason, the proper method of determining the   present value of future losses requires that the total amount of future losses   be reduced by a certain amount. This is done by making an allowance for the   interest that this total sum of money would earn for such period of time. This   allowance is calculated by a process called discounting or reducing the total   future financial losses during the period of expectancy by applying a fixed   interest figure. In other words, you should determine the amount of survivor's   yearly loss, if any, and then award a lump sum which when invested will pay out   from that lump sum, plus the interest it will earn, an amount equal to the   yearly loss to the survivor. Furthermore, the fund you create must be completely   used up or exhausted at the end of the period of the loss. In making this   computation you may also take into account the extent to which inflation will   probably reduce the value of money during the period of the loss. You may   determine to what extent the purchasing power of the dollar will be recovered   because of inflation, you should increase the total amount of your award for   anticipated future financial losses in order to offset the extent by which   inflation will reduce the value of the dollar in the future. You should also   know that any award you may make is not subject to Federal income tax. However,   the interest earned on the amount of your award will be subject to income   taxation. And, therefore, you should increase the fund to account for the   survivors' increased tax liability. So, in evaluating future losses, there are   several factors which should be considered by you in arriving at your   computation of future losses. Remember with respect to future losses that you   are creating a present fund which will be used to pay plaintiff from the   principal sum and the interest it earns in an amount equal to a survivor's   yearly loss so that at the end of the period of time you determine this loss   will be sustained, the fund plus the interest will be used up. Let me repeat the   factors you should consider when determining an amount to compensate plaintiff   for future losses: (1) The amount of the survivor's yearly loss. (2) The period   of time over which said loss will be incurred in the future, i.e., from today's   date forward for that period of time you determine to be the balance of   decedent's work life expectancy. (Remember you will have already determined the   loss from the date of death to today). (3) That the fund should be discounted to   reflect the interest the fund will earn. (4) The extent to which inflation may   or may not affect the value of the financial loss. (5) That no income tax will   be imposed on the sum awarded but that the interest earned by the fund will be   subject to Federal income tax. I am now going to give each of you a sheet of   paper which contains a step by step illustration of how to compute the present   value of a survivor's future pecuniary loss. The sheet also contains an example   from an imaginary case to show you how the various formulas are applied. Keep in   mind that the numbers used in the example are not taken from this case and are   not intended to suggest what figures you should use. The amount of any given   survivor's financial loss, interest rates and discount rates must be based upon   your own sound judgment resulting from your understanding and analysis of the   evidence in the case as well as your collective experience and common sense. [An   expert testified as to his/her analysis of future wage increases and discount   rates relative to inflation and gave you his/her opinion of what the discount   and inflation rates should be in this case. giving due regard to his/her   credibility, you may use those trends and rates in arriving at your own   independent single appraisal of the survivors' actual pecuniary losses].See   footnote 3 Arriving at a figure that represents the plaintiff's financial and   pecuniary loss due to the decedent's premature death is difficult. Remember that   your decision should be based upon your own common sense judgment of the amount   of money and the value of services and guidance decedent would have contributed   to the welfare of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Thus, to recapitulate, if you find plaintiffs are entitled to an award based   upon the rules of law I have given you, then in determining the amount of award   because of the premature death of decedent you must first determine the amount   of financial loss suffered from the date of death to the present time. To arrive   at that figure you must add the amount of plaintiff's yearly loss for the number   of years from the date of death to the present time. Next, you should add to   that amount a sum which represents the future loss from today calculated in   accordance with my instructions.</p>
<p>COMPUTATION OF PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE FINANCIAL LOSS:</p>
<p>1. Insert here the total amount of money the survivor has lost by reason of   the death. $______ 2. Insert here the average annual rate of interest for the   period of the survivor's loss. _______% 3. Insert here the amount of money which   is necessary to be invested at the rate determined in 2. in order to yield the   loss determine in 2. [Formula: Subtract the rate set forth in 2. from 100%. Then   multiply the number in 1. by that percentage]. $______ 4. Insert here the   average annual rate of inflation for the period of the survivor's loss.   __________% 5. Insert here the amount of money necessary to add to the   survivor's loss to account for inflation. [Formula: Multiply the inflation   factor in 4. by the loss set forth in 1.] $__________ 6. Insert here the amount   of money necessary to compensate the survivor taking into consideration both   investment and inflation factors. [Formula: Add 3. to 5.]. $__________</p>
<p>Example: Assuming a loss to the survivor of $1,500/year for four years with   an average interest rate of eight percent and an average inflation rate of six   percent: Step One: $1,500/year x four years $6,000</p>
<p>Step Two: Interest rate (averaged for four years) 8%</p>
<p>Step Three: (100% - 8% = 92%) ($6,000 x 92% = $5,520) $5,520</p>
<p>Step Four: Inflation rate (averaged for four years) 6%</p>
<p>Step Five: ($6,000 x 6% = $360) $ 360</p>
<p>Step Six: ($5,520 + $360 = $5,880) $5,880</p>
<p>Footnote: 1 This passage in brackets should be used only where evidence of   the decedent's work life has been offered or where evidence of a survivor's life   expectancy is relevant to a determination of pecuniary loss and the Court has   been asked to take judicial notice of the life expectancy tables.</p>
<p>Footnote: 2 In the event that no evidence has been produced as to decedent's   income tax liability, the trial judge should consider whether this phrase should   be included in the charge.</p>
<p>Footnote: 3 The Committee expresses no opinion as to the need for expert   testimony on interest (discount) or inflation factors. It recognizes that cases   involving wrongful death claims are tried without expert testimony. The charge   is structured to be used in either event.</p>
<p>The Committee also acknowledges that Matthews v. Nelson, 57 N.J. Super. 515   (App. Div. 1959) permits the use of annuity tables contained in the Civil   Practice Rules. Those tables express certain interest rates but no corresponding   inflation factors.</p>
