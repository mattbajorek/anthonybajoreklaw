<h2 align="center"><strong>39:6B-2 Driving Without Insurance - Strict Liability and Substantial Penalties</strong></h2>
<p align="center">
<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC represents individuals charged with criminal and serious traffic violations   throughout New Jersey.</p>
<p>The mandatory penalties imposed for driving without insurance is greater than   the first offender penalties for drunk driving or possession of marijuana.   Mandatory penalties include automatic loss of license for one year, $300.00 fine   and a period of community service to be determined by the Municipal Court.   N.J.S.A. 39:6B-2 The no car insurance statute is one of the few strict liability   statutes. &quot;Every owner or registered owner of a motor vehicle registered or   principally garaged in this state shall maintain motor vehicle coverage, under   provisions approved by the Commissioner of Insurance.&quot; N.J.S.A. 39:6B-1 There   are also court costs and insurance surcharges of $250.00 per year for three   years. Failure to produce at the time of trial an insurance card or insurance   policy covering the date of the offense creates a rebuttable presumption that   the person was uninsured when charged with the offense.</p>
<p> In State v. Kopp, 171 NJ Super 528 (Law Div. 1980), the courts   established that knowledge of lack of insurance is not a defense. The   legislative intent is clear that knowledge of lack of insurance is not an   essential element which must be proved in order to sustain a conviction of an   owner who operates a car without insurance. However, the section which imposes   penalties against an individual who operates a motor vehicle without liability   insurance does not apply to a New Jersey resident who is driving an automobile   owned by an out-of-state friend who had been in New Jersey for five weeks. State   v. Arslanouk, 67 NJ Super 387 (App. Div. 1979)</p>
<p> The Appellate Division, in the State v. Hochman, 188 NJ Super 382   (App. Div. 1982) examined and reversed a conviction for operating without   liability insurance where the State failed to carry its burden of proving that   an automobile liability insurance was lawfully canceled. In this fact specific   case, defendant was charged with operating a vehicle he owned without insurance.   It was stipulated that because of long hours defendant worked, he had asked his   wife to look after household matters, including insurance matters, and gave her   several thousand dollars each month to pay for them. Defendant Hochmans wife   arranged through an insurance broker to have Allstate insure the vehicle. The   insurance broker then arranged to finance the insurance premiums through a &quot;Lee   Finance&quot; financial service. The defendants wife then paid the broker and agreed   to pay the balance to the financial service in monthly installments of $48.00.   Id at 384.</p>
<p> Thereafter, defendant Hochmans wife made payments to the financial   service through October 13, 1979. On October 15, 1979 Allstate informed   defendants wife by mail that there was due and owing a premium of $331.00 and   payment should be made immediately. The defendants wife notified the broker that   she had received a letter from Allstate and reminded the broker that the   insurance premiums were being financed through the finance agency pursuant to   financing agreement arranged by it and therefore she did not have to pay the   balance of the account.</p>
<p> The insurance broker informed the Defendant Hochmans wife that it   would investigate the problem and contact her. In January 1980, because the   defendants wife had not heard from the insurance broker, she again contacted the   insurance broker and informed him that she had received no further   correspondence from Allstate. She inquired into the status of the insurance of   the vehicle, the broker informed the defendants wife they were still   investigating the problem and would contact her when it had been resolved. It   was further stipulated in Court that defendant was never told by his wife of the   finance agreement or of the difficulties she had encountered with the insurance.   In May 1980, defendant was transferred to another office and needed to use the   car to get to work. According to stipulated facts, defendants wife told the   defendant that the vehicle could be driven. Defendant, relying upon what his   wife had told him and believing that the vehicle was insured, drove the vehicle   until July 15, 1980 when he was charged with violating the compulsory insurance   provisions of N.J.S.A. 39:6B-2.</p>
<p> The insurance broker, as an agent, had issued an insurance   identification card indicating the insurance would remain in effect from the   period August 28, 1979 to August 28, 1980. In December 1979 defendant and his   wife moved from the residence in Montclair and left a forwarding address.   Thereafter in preparing for trial defendant learned that in October and November   1979 Lee Finance had liquidated without informing its clients, including   defendants wife.</p>
<p> Although Allstate claimed it mailed a cancellation notice, it   stipulated that it had mailed the cancellation notice to an incorrect address,   mailing it to 313 Park Street rather than 314 Park Street. The broker, First   City, never informed defendants wife, despite her inquiry, that Allstate had   canceled the insurance policy or that the finance agency had liquidated, or that   she could reinstate the policy by paying the balance due on the annual premium.   The Appellate Division noted that in order to convict a defendant-owner of   operating a motor vehicle in violation of the insurance provisions, the State   did not have to show a culpable mental state, i.e., that defendant knew his   vehicle was uninsured. The State simply had the burden of proving beyond a   reasonable doubt that (1) defendant owned the vehicle, (2) the vehicle was   registered in New Jersey, (3) defendant operated the vehicle or caused it to be   operated upon any public road or highway in this State, and (4) the vehicle was   without liability insurance coverage required by N.J.S.A. 39:6B-1. Id at   387.</p>
<p> The Appellate Division held that the first three elements of the   offenses were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The pivotal issue was whether   the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the fourth element of the   defense, that the vehicle was uninsured. The question was thus whether the   liability insurance policy had been lawfully and effectively canceled when   Defendant Hochman was charged for the offense. The Court found that Allstate had   not properly canceled the insurance policy. The Court held;</p>
<p> &quot;A notice of cancellation of a policy of automobile liability   insurance is effective in this State only if it is based on one or more   statutorily enumerated reasons, including the nonpayment of premiums. N.J.S.A.   17:29C-7(A)(a). Moreover, prior to March 10, 1981, where, as here, the   cancellation was for nonpayment of premiums, the notice of cancellation must   have been mailed or delivered by the insurance carrier (here Allstate) to the   insured (here either defendant or his wife) at least ten days prior to the   effective date of cancellation and must have been accompanied by a statement of   the reason given for such cancellation. N.J.S.A. 17:29C-8. Proof of mailing of   the notice of cancellation to the named insured at the address shown in the   policy was deemed sufficient proof of notice. N.J.S.A. 17:29C-10. Under this   latter statue, cancellation was effective whether or not the insured actually   received notice of cancellation because proof of mailing, not proof of receipt,   was the determinative factor. See Weathers v. Hartford Ins. Group, 77 N.J. 228,   234 (1978. Proof of mailing the notice, however, is not conclusive on the issue.   The insured may still offer proof that he never received the notice &quot;for the   purpose of refuting the hypothesis of mailing.&quot; Id. at 235. Thus, in Weathers,   the Supreme Court held:</p>
<p> Although the inference of non-mailing provided by evidence of   non-receipt might in most cases be outweighed by the inferences of mailing which   may be drawn from a certificate of mailing whose reliability has been   established, we discern no cogent reason for depriving the trier of fact of such   evidence by holding it inadmissible , they are not conclusive of that issue and   do not preclude the existence of a genuine issue of material fact in the face of   a claim of non-receipt so as to entitle the insurer to judgment as a matter of   law. See Sudduth v. Commonwealth County Mutual Ins. Co., 454 S. W. 2d 196 (Tex.   Sup. Ct. 1970); 9 Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. 1940) Sec. 2519; cf. Fitzpatrick   v. Merchants and Manufacturers Fire Ins. Co., 122 N.J.L. 468 (E. &amp;A. 1939).   The contrary holding of Womack v. Fenton, 28 N.J. Super. 345 (App. Div. 1953),   on this point is hereby overruled. Permitting the fact finder to consider the   addressee-insureds denial of receipt of the notice of cancellation does not   improperly add to the insurers statutory burden of proving mailing by requiring   it to prove actual receipt of the notice since such testimony is admissible only   as the basis for an inference of its non-mailing. The insurer still need only   prove constructive notice by adequately establishing that the notice of   cancellation was mailed. Hochman at 388-389 Weathers at 235-236</p>
<p> The court noted that although Allstate claimed that a notice of   cancellation was sent to the defendants wife, this did not establish that the   notice satisfied the statutory requirement of N.J.S.A. 17:29C-8. There is no   proof that the notice mailed to the named insured (assuming that defendants wife   was the insured named in the policy) or that it was mailed to the address shown   in the policy, or that its contents complied with statutory requirements. The   court held &quot;thus, we are constrained to hold that the State failed to sustain   its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the Allstate automobile   liability insurance policy covering defendants vehicle was lawfully canceled.   The Allstate policy therefore was presumptively in full force and effect... and   defendants conviction for violating the compulsory insurance provisions of   N.J.S.A. 39:6B-2 cannot stand. Hochman at 389-390.</p>
<p> The insurance statutes under Title 19 of the New Jersey laws contain   provisions which sometimes provide that all members of a household are covered   under a policy issued to one member even if their name is not set forth on the   policy. The uninsured defendant who lives with someone who owns an insured car   may be included under that persons policy.</p>
<p> Operation is different in non-insurance matters than in drunk driving   cases. A defendant who is seated in the drivers seat, behind the steering wheel   of a vehicle that is under tow and was in physical control of the vehicle did   not &quot;operate&quot; the vehicle for the purposes of prohibiting operating the vehicle   while suspended, operating uninsured vehicle and operating unregistered vehicle,   where the vehicle did not have an engine and incapable of being operated under   its own power. Counsel can argue the state must prove the defendant drove the   vehicle. State v. Derby, 256 N.J. Super. 702, (Law Div. 1992).</p>
<p> In a case involving Personal Injury Protection/ No Fault PIP benefits   the Appellate Division recently ruled that an insurance company did not properly   mail a notice of cancellation, thus the policy was not canceled. In Hodges v.   Pennsylvania National Insurance Company, _____ NJ Super. _____ (App. Div. 1992),   plaintiff was in a motor vehicle accident operating a vehicle owned by her   mother. Plaintiff filed a PIP suit against the insurance company which had   refused to pay medical bills and property damage. Defendants insurance company   claimed it canceled Alva Hodges policy on December 16, 1988 for failure to remit   the premium payment. Defendant submitted two pages of a November 28, 1988 &quot;JUA   Mailing List,&quot; which indicated Alva Hodges as an insured who was scheduled to be   sent a notice of cancellation. The mailing list contained two November 28 stamps   of the Harrisburg Post Office and two stamps of postage for the numerous letters   of $39.00 and $99.75. The two postage stamps together totaled $138.75. The list   claimed a &quot;total mailing&quot; of 640 notices. Plaintiff pointed out that a mailing   of 640 notices at $.25 per piece (the 1988 postage stamp price) should have   totaled $160.00. Because defendant paid only $138.75, plaintiff contends that   all the lists and notices may not have been mailed. The mailing list also   contained a signature and certification of one of the defendants employees.</p>
<p> Plaintiffs counsel in Hodges pointed out that the Post Offices   standard proof of mailing procedure differed from defendants use of a preprinted   mailing list. Plaintiff pointed out that the US Postal Service utilizes a   &quot;Certificate of Mailing,&quot; PS Form 3817, for the purposes documenting proof of   mailing by regular mail. Prior to the stamping of this receipt, the Postal   Service employees individually compares the receipt with the item being mailed.   These forms are available in advance from the Post Office. (A copy of the first   class mailing Certificate of Mailing was included as a footnote to the Courts   opinion.) The Hodges Court noted that N.J.S.A. 17:29C-10 specifically enumerates   the circumstances on which a notice of cancellation is effective:</p>
<p> &quot;no written notice of cancellation or of intention not to renew sent   by an insurer to an insured in accordance with the provisions of an automobile   insurance shall be effective unless a. (1) it is sent by certified mail, or (2)   at the time of the mailing of said notice by regular mail, the insurer has   obtained from the Post Office Department a date stamped proof of mailing showing   the name and address of the insured and b. the insurer has retained a duplicate   copy of the mailed notice which is certified to be true. Slip op at 6. [Emphasis   added by the Court.]</p>
<p> In order to be effective, notice of cancellation &quot;must be set in   strict compliance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 17:29C-10.&quot; Citing Lopez v.   New Jersey Automobile Full Underwriting Association, 239 NJ Super. 13, 20, (App.   Div.), certif. den. 122 N.J. 131 (1990) (absence of proof of personal knowledge   of mailing by postal employee or insurer employee renders notice ineffective).   The Court questioned whether the stamped proof of payment of money in postage   was proof of mailing. The Appellate Division in Hodges noted that our Courts   have interpreted the statute to require a precise proof of mailing, usually the   official &quot;U.S. Postal Service Certificate of Mailing.&quot;</p>
<p> In Celino v. General Accident Insurance, 211 N.J. Super. 538 (App.   Div. 1986), the Court ruled that this specific postal certificate of mailing   satisfied the statutes proof of mailing requirement. Celino at 540-541   (determining that the insurers notice was ineffective because insured failed to   retain a duplicate copy of the notice, thereby violating part (b) of the   statute). The Appellate Division in Celino determined that defendants proof of   payment of postage and the employees certification fell far short of the quality   of proof inherent in an official post office certificate. Because the defendants   proofs were insufficient to establish compliance with the statute, there existed   an unresolved issues of fact. The Appellate Division found that the trial court   erred and granting in summary judgment and remanded the question as to notice   for further proceedings.</p>
<p> If there is a question involving improper cancellation or improper   notice, we would suggest your attorney prepare a subpoena to the insurance   company and also a hand delivered subpoena to your insurance broker. You may   discover notice of cancellation was improper or notices mailed to the wrong   address. We all know the poor track record by JUA and MTF companies.</p>
<p> If a husband and wife, or both, are named in the policy, Lumbermens   Mutual Casualty Co. v. Carriere 170 N.J. Super. 437, 450 (Law Div. 1979)   supports the proposition that both husband and wife named in the policy should   receive notice.</p>
<p> A cancellation notice is invalid if issued before the premium due   date. Recently, in Christian v. Ormsby, _____ N.J. Super _____ (Law Div. decided   December 18, 1992), the court held under N.J.S.A. 17:29C-8, an automobile   insurer may not issue a cancellation notice to the insured for non-payment of   premiums before the date on which the premium is due. (This case also dealt with   the incompetent JUA.) The Christian notices of cancellation and a reminder   notice were mailed by Liberty Mutual. However, the court found that the notice   was ineffective to cancel the policy before the accident Plaintiff Christian was   involved in. The court found that although the notice issued by Liberty Mutual   to the Christians on October 21, 1987 stated its reason for cancellation as   &quot;non-payment of premium,&quot; the court found that, on the date the notice was   mailed, the Christians premium to the JUA was not past due and the Christians   were not yet in default.</p>
<p> The court also rejected the JUAs argument that the cancellation   notice could have been mailed at any time after the premium notice, so long as   it did not become effective until after the due date. The court interpreted the   statutory language requires 15 days notice of cancellation in a language   referring to &quot;non-payment of premium&quot; together to imply a legislative intent to   provide with a 15-day grace period after default in the payment of an automobile   insurance policy premium before the insurer is able to effectively cancel the   policy. The purpose is to allow defaulting policyholders an opportunity during   that grace period to pay their premiums and to keep the policy in force.   Consequently, any cancellation notice issued before such default is premature   and invalid.</p>
<p> A bad check will permit insurer to cancel insurance policy. In   Abdel-Rahman v. Ludas, _____ NJ Super _____ (App. Div. decided July 7, 1993), an   insurers acceptance of a check in payment of a premium is conditioned upon   payment by the drawee institution. An insureds failure to pay the premium, which   occurs when the check is dishonored, entitles the insurer to cancel the policy.   On August 13, 1990, Ohio Casualty issued a three-month, short-term reinstatement   of policy. Included in the reinstatement letter to the insured was a notice   advising the reinstatement would be considered void from its inception if the   check accepted in payment of the reinstatement was dishonored when presented to   the drawee bank.</p>
<p> On August 22, Ohio Casualty learned that the check was dishonored by   the insureds bank. Having a policy of presenting a check twice for payment, Ohio   Casualty redeposited the check that same date. The check was again returned for   insufficient funds on August 24. On both occasions the bank mailed notices of   the dishonoring to the insured. The insureds bank statement also indicated that   the checks had been dishonored.</p>
<p> Ohio Casualty canceled insured Ludas policy on September 6, 1990. On   September 12, 1990, the company informed Ludas of the cancellation, which was   retroactively effective July 29, 1990. The insured did no dispute the facts but   claimed that the family made a mistake and deposited the money into the wrong   account. Both the motion judge and the Appellate Division found that mere   delivery of the check, &quot;a worthless piece of paper,&quot; to the insurer was not   enough to keep the policy in effect.</p>
<p> The non-insurance NJSBA 39:6B-2 statute provides there is a   rebuttable presumption of no insurance if no card or policy produced. Remember,   however, that a presumption does not equal guilty.</p>
<p> The charge of simple operation without insurance by the non-owner   presents additional viable defenses to the charge of no insurance. There is not   a strict liability provision involving mere operators. The State must prove the   operator knew or should have known from the attendant circumstances that the   motor vehicle was without motor vehicle liability coverage. Such facts can be   gathered from the relationship between the parties, whether or not the vehicle   had a valid inspection sticker and testimony by the owner who often is also   issued an uninsured motorist charge.</p>
<p> In Matlad v. US Services, 174 NJ Super. 499 417 A. 2d 46 (App. Div.   1980), where husband canceled policy without telling wife, deletion was void as   against public policy and coverage continued for wife. The defendant/owner must   operate or cause the car to be operated. If a driver took the car without   permission that day, the owner did not cause the vehicle to be operated.</p>
<p> The State is still required to provide discovery. Occasionally a case   is dismissed because the State failed to provide discovery. The bottom line is   never let your insurance expire. Mandatory penalties are automatic loss of   license for one year, $300.00 fine and a period of community service to be   determined by the Municipal Court. If you don't have insurance, don't drive.</p>
<p> No insurance penalties increased 2002</p>
<p> 39:6B-2. Penalties</p>
<p> 2. Any owner or registrant of a motor vehicle registered or   principally garaged in this State who operates or causes to be operated a motor   vehicle upon any public road or highway in this State without motor vehicle   liability insurance coverage required by this act, and any operator who operates   or causes a motor vehicle to be operated and who knows or should know from the   attendant circumstances that the motor vehicle is without motor vehicle   liability insurance coverage required by this act shall be subject, for the   first offense, to a fine of not less than $300 nor more than $1,000 and a period   of community service to be determined by the court, and shall forthwith forfeit   his right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for a   period of one year from the date of conviction.? Upon subsequent conviction, he   shall be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 and shall be subject to imprisonment   for a term of 14 days and shall be ordered by the court to perform community   service for a period of 30 days, which shall be of such form and on such terms   as the court shall deem appropriate under the circumstances, and shall forfeit   his right to operate a motor vehicle for a period of two years from the date of   his conviction, and, after the expiration of said period, he may make   application to the Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles for a license to   operate a motor vehicle, which application may be granted at the discretion of   the director. The directors discretion shall be based upon an assessment of the   likelihood that the individual will operate or cause a motor vehicle to be   operated in the future without the insurance coverage required by this act. A   complaint for violation of this act may be made to a municipal court at any time   within six months after the date of the alleged offense.</p>
<p> Failure to produce at the time of trial an insurance identification   card or an insurance policy which was in force for the time of operation for   which the offense is charged creates a rebuttable presumption that the person   was uninsured when charged with a violation of this section.</p>
