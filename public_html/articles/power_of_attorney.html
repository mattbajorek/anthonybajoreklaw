<h1 align="center"><strong>Power of Attorney</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>An important part of lifetime planning is the Power of Attorney. Valid in all   states, these documents give one or more persons the power to act on your   behalf. The power may be limited to a particular activity (e.g., closing the   sale of your home) or general in its application, empowering one or more persons   to act on your behalf in a variety of situations. It may take effective   immediately or only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., a determination   that you are unable to act for yourself). The latter are &quot;springing&quot; Powers of   Attorney. It may give temporary or continuous, permanent authority to act on   your behalf. A power of attorney may be revoked, but most states require written   notice of revocation to the person named to act for you.</p>
<p>The person named in a Power of Attorney to act on your behalf is commonly   referred to as your &quot;agent&quot; or &quot;attorney-in-fact.&quot; With a valid Power of   Attorney, your agent can take any action permitted in the document. Often your   agent must present the actual document to invoke the power. For example, if   another person is acting on your behalf to sell an automobile, the motor   vehicles department generally will require that the Power of Attorney be   presented before your agents authority to sign the title will be honored.   Similarly, an agent who signs documents to buy or sell real property on your   behalf must present the Power of Attorney to the title company. The same applies   to sale of securities or opening and closing bank accounts. However, your agent   generally should not need to present the Power of Attorney when signing checks   for you.</p>
<p>Why would anyone give such sweeping authority to another person? One answer   is convenience. If you are buying or selling assets and do not wish to appear in   person to close the transaction, you may take advantage of a Power of Attorney.   Another important reason to use Powers of Attorney is to prepare for situations   when you may not be able to act on your own behalf due to absence or incapacity.   Such a disability may be temporary (e.g., due to travel, accident, or illness)   or it may be permanent.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Power of Attorney and become unable to manage your   personal or business affairs, it may become necessary for a court to appoint one   or more people to act for you. People appointed in this manner are referred to   as guardians, conservators, or committees, depending upon your local state law.   If a court proceeding, sometimes known as intervention, is needed, than you may   not have the ability to choose the person who will act for you. With A Power of   Attorney, you choose who will act and define their authority and its limits, if   any.</p>

<p>What are these powers of attorney?</p>
<p>A Power of Attorney is a written document in which a competent adult   individual (the &quot;principal&quot;) appoints another competent adult individual (the   &quot;attorney-in-fact&quot;) to act on the principal's behalf. In general, an   attorney-in-fact may perform any legal function or task which the principal has   a legal right to do for him/herself.</p>
<p>The term &quot;durable&quot; in reference to a power of attorney means that the power   remains in force for the lifetime of the principal, even if he/she becomes   mentally incapacitated. A principal may cancel a power of attorney at any time   for any reason. Powers granted on a power of attorney document can be very broad   or very narrow in accordance with the needs of the principal.</p>
<p>Why is Power of Attorney so important?</p>
<p>Every adult has day-to-day affairs to manage, such as paying the bills. Many   people are under the impression that, in the event of catastrophic illness or   injury, a spouse or child can automatically act for them. Unfortunately, this is   often wrong, even when joint ownership situations exist.</p>
<p>The lack of properly prepared and executed power of attorney can cause   extreme difficulties when an individual is stricken with severe illness or   injury rendering him/her unable to make decisions or manage financial and   medical affairs. All states have legal procedures, guardianships or   conservatorships, to provide for appointment of a Guardian. These normally   require formal proceedings and are expensive in court. This means involvement of   lawyers to prepare and file the necessary papers and doctors to provide medical   testimony regarding the mental incapacity of the subject of the action. The   procedures also require the involvement of a temporary guardian to investigate,   even intercede, in surrogate proceedings. This can be slow, costly, and very   frustrating.</p>
<p>Advance preparation of the power of attorney can avoid the inconvenience and   expense of legal proceedings. This needs to be done while the principal is   competent, alert and aware of the consequences of his/her decision. Once a   serious problem occurs, it is too late.</p>
<p>The Power of Attorney can be effective immediately upon signing or only upon   disability. Some examples of legal powers contained in the Power of Attorney are   the following:</p>
<p>1. 2. REAL ESTATE: To execute all contracts, deeds, bonds, mortgages, notes,   checks, drafts, money orders, and to lease, collect rents, grant, bargain, sell,   or borrow and mortgage, and to manage, compromise, settle, and adjust all   matters pertaining to real estate. 3.
