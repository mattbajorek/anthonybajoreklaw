<p>Buying and Selling Real Estate</p>
<p>Nearly everyone, at some time in life, faces the details of buying and   selling real estate. The purchase of a home is probably the largest single   investment a person will ever undertake and, therefore, careful consideration   should be given to the technical difficulties involved in the transfer of real   estate before any action is taken.</p>
<p>The Contract for Sale</p>
<p>Once youve found the house youd like to buy and have agreed on the price, you   will probably be asked to sign a contract and pay a deposit.</p>
<p>A Contract of Sale is an agreement for the purchase and sale of real estate.   This is the most important document in any real estate transaction because it   establishes the respective rights and responsibilities of the purchaser and the   seller.</p>
<p>Since the Contract of Sale is such an important and legally binding Contract   an attorney should be consulted within 3 days of signing. The 3 day attorney   review period is to protect the buyer and seller from being forever bound by a   contract without their receiving the benefit of legal advice. A lawyer is   trained to answer your questions and most attorneys will provide an   introductory, no-obligation conference for a nominal fee. At the conference the   attorney will be able to provide you with a good estimate of closing costs and   other costs involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>You only have three days to have your attorney review the contract and make   the appropriate changes. Remember that once a Contract is signed and in final   form after 3 days, your rights and obligations are fixed concerning the   transaction and your attorney will no longer have the opportunity to structure   the Contract to meet your objectives.</p>
<p>Whether you are a seller or a buyer, you should understand the Contract terms   and how they affect you. The other parties to the contract are under no   obligation to tell you what the contract means and you may not understand the   legal meaning of the terminology. So, if you are going to have an attorney   represent you in the transaction, the time to consult one is either before you   sign any papers or within 2 days of signing.</p>
<p>The Contract of Sale should state the parties, the purchase price and how it   is to be paid, an adequate description of the property being sold, the kind of   deed to be delivered, the quality of the sellers title to the property included   in the sale, the date you are to take possession, and other clauses relating to   the property and the parties respective responsibilities to each other.</p>
<p>The contract should also permit the buyer to cancel the contract if financing   cant be obtained and provide for the return of the down payment if the sale   falls through. Or, perhaps the seller may want to retain possession of the   property for some time in order to find new accommodations. If so, appropriate   clauses can be included in the contract defining such rights.</p>
<p>These are only a few matters usually covered in the contract. However, they   illustrate the variety of terms and conditions to be considered when you enter   into such a transaction.</p>
<p>How A Lawyer Can Help</p>
<p>There are many important ways in which an attorney can help protect your   interests during a real estate transaction.</p>
<p>For example, the purchasers attorney (depending on local practice) can:</p>
<p>* Prepare, review and explain the contract of sale.<br />
  * Assist you regarding   your questions on matters such as termite inspections, structural inspections,   the zoning status of your property, restrictions on construction or use, and   property insurance.<br />
  * Review your mortgage commitment and explain your   prepayment rights.<br />
  * Order and review the survey and all title searches to   clearly define the description, location and legal ownership of the   property.<br />
  * Help to resolve any title problems.<br />
  * Obtain title insurance   policies covering your ownership interest and lending institutions mortgage   interest, and advise you about exceptions which may appear in your title   policy.<br />
  * Settle any problems regarding transfer of occupancy, settlement   date and possession.<br />
  * Determine adjustments for taxes and other costs.<br />
  *   Prepare the final closing statement and other documents.<br />
  * Represent and   advise you at the closing where documents such as the closing statement, the   sellers deed and affidavit of title and the note and mortgage are signed. Also   All funds are transferred at this time.<br />
  * Record the deed and mortgage and   cancel any existing mortgages and liens.<br />
  * Deliver all important documents to   you for your safekeeping after closing.</p>
<p>The sellers attorney can:</p>
<p>* Prepare, review and explain the contract of sale.<br />
  * Gather important   title information for the purchasers attorney, thus expediting the search and   survey process.<br />
  * Resolve any title problems revealed by the searches.<br />
  *   Cooperate with the purchasers attorney in resolving possession and closing date   problems.<br />
  * Assist you in determining the correct balance due on your   mortgage.<br />
  * Cooperate with the purchasers attorney in preparing the final   closing statement.<br />
  * Prepare the deed affidavit of title, survey affidavit   and any other necessary documents.<br />
  * Represent you at the closing and make   certain that you receive the correct amount of proceeds from the sale.</p>
<p>Of course, these items represent only a partial list of services which may be   rendered by attorneys during real estate transactions. Your attorney will   perform any additional services necessitated by your particular purchase or   sale.</p>
<p>Representation</p>
<p>Remember one important point - the seller, broker, and bank in the   transaction may have their own legal staff representing each of their interests.   An attorney representing any of the other parties is not your attorney.</p>
<p>It is your own responsibility as the buyer, to seek the professional advice   of an attorney to protect yourself and to be sure that you get precisely what   you are legally entitled to receive.</p>
<p>When you retain an attorney for the purchase of sale of real estate, you   obtain the services of a loyal and trustworthy advisor who will guide your   transaction from contract to closing. Mainly because of your attorneys efforts,   the closing should be calm and amicable meeting for the signing of documents and   the transferring of funds.</p>
<p>Home Inspection</p>
<p>The attorney also may represent his clients interests in connection with the   home inspection report. Upon receiving a copy of the home inspections report   (which generally involves a structural and environmental analysis of the   property to be purchased or sold), the attorney for the buyer, after   consultation with his client, will request certain repairs and/or remediation of   the conditions noted by the home inspector.</p>
<p>In response, the attorney for the seller will advise what action the seller   is willing to take to meet the buyers concerns. Often depending on the terms of   the contract, if agreement cannot be reached on issues raised by the home   inspection report, the buyer or seller may cancel the contract. More   realistically, however, the attorneys for the seller and buyer work to reach a   compromise acceptable to both clients.</p>
<p>Closing</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that buying a home is a major investment.   It usually involves making payments over a period of 30 years. In the long run,   its likely to be more economical to have competent professional advice - your   attorneys advice - in making the purchase than to risk the trouble and expense   that could result from not having that advice in the first place.</p>
