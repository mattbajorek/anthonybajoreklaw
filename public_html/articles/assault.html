<p>2C:12-1.1. Knowingly leaving scene of motor vehicle accident resulting in   serious bodily injury, fourth degree crime; sentencing</p>
<p> 2. A motor vehicle operator who knows he is involved in an accident and   knowingly leaves the scene of that accident under circumstances that violate the   provisions of R.S.39:4-129 shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree if   the accident results in serious bodily injury to another person.</p>

<p> For the purposes of this section, neither knowledge of the serious   bodily injury nor knowledge of the violation are elements of the offense and it   shall not be a defense that the driver of the motor vehicle was unaware of the   serious bodily injury or provisions of R.S.39:4-129.</p>
<p> L.1997,c.111,s.2.</p>
<p>-  In an indictable criminal case, the Judge will read the following   Instructions and Law to the Jury:</p>
<p>SIMPLE AS       The defendant is charged in the indictment with aggravated   assault. If you find the defendant not guilty of aggravated assault. You should   consider the lesser included offense of simple assault. The portion of the   statute dealing with simple assault reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p> A person is guilty of a       In order for you to find the defendant   guilty of this lesser included offense, the State must prove the essential   elem       1. That the defendant attempted to cause or actually caused bodily   injury to anothe       Bodily injury is defined as physical pain, illness or any   impairment of the physical condition. This is different that the &quot;serious bodily   injury&quot; I defined for you in regard to aggravated assault.</p>
<p>NOTE: Charge as required (depending on the applicable Aggravated    &amp;nbs       In conclusion, no defendant may be found guilty of an offense,   unless the State has proven each element of the offense beyond a reasonable   doubt. If the</p>
<p>State has failed to prove        On the other hand, if the State has proven   the crime charged and each of its elements beyond a a reasonable doubt, you must   find the defendant guilty.4</p>
<p>1 This charge is intended for use in connection with one of the model charges   on Aggravated Assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1b, only. Harassment is a lesser-included   offense of Simple Assault. State v. Berka, 211 N.J. Super. 717, 721 (App. Div.   1986). Simple Assault is not a lesser-included of Sexual Assault or Criminal   Sexual Contact. State v. Queen, 221 N.J. Super. 601 (App. Div. 1988).</p>
<p>2 The statute includes &quot;Attempts to Cause.&quot; If facts require, charge Attempt   along with this charge. See N.J.S.A. 2C:5-1a.</p>
<p>3 See Model Charge on Aggravated Assault-Serious Bodily Injury, N.J.S.A.   2C:12-1b(1).</p>
<p>4 N.J.S.A. 2C:1-13a. See also State v. Ragland, 105 N.J. 189 (1986).</p>
<p> In Count of the indictment, the defendant(s) is (are) charged with the   crime of</p>
<p>aggravated assault in that he/she/they allegedly on in the (Date)   (Municipality)</p>
<p> The defendant(s) is (are) accused of violating a section of our state   statutes that reads as follows: /p&gt;</p>
<p>A person is guilty of aggravated assault if he. . . . (a) ttempts to cause   significant bodily injury to another or causes significant bodily injury   purposely or knowingly or, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference   to the value of human life recklessly causes such significant bodily injury.</p>
<p align="left">Under this statute, the defendant(s) can be found guilty if   he/she/they EITHER caused significant bodily injury to another OR attempted to   cause significant bodily injury to another.</p>
<p>To find the defendant(s) guilty of aggravated assault for causing significant   bodily injury to another, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of   the following elements:</p>
<p>1. That the defendant(s) caused significant bodily injury to another; and</p>
<p>2. That the defendant(s) acted purposely or knowingly or acted recklessly   under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human   life.The first element that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is   that the defendant(s) caused significant bodily injury to another.Significant   bodily injury means bodily injury which creates a temporary loss of the function   of any bodily member or organ or temporary loss of any one of the five senses.   As you know, the five senses are sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell. The   second element that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the   defendant(s) acted purposely or knowingly or acted recklessly under   circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. A   person acts purposely with respect to the result of his/her conduct if it is   his/her conscious object to cause such a result. A person acts purposely if   he/she acts with design, with a specific intent, with a particular object or   purpose, or if he/she means to do what he/she does (e.g., &quot;I did it on   purpose&quot;). A person acts knowingly with respect to the result of his/her conduct   if he/she is aware that it is practically certain that his/her conduct will   cause such a result. A person acts recklessly with respect to the result of   his/her conduct if he/she consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable   risk that the result will occur from his/her conduct. The risk must be of such a   nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actors conduct   and the circumstances known to the actor, its disregard involves a gross   deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in   the actorss situation. One is said to act recklessly if one acts with   recklessness, with scorn for the consequences, heedlessly, fool-hardily. The   phrase &quot;under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of   human life&quot; does not focus on the state of mind of the actor, but rather on the   circumstances under whichyou find that he/she acted. If, in light of all the   evidence, you find that the conduct of the defendant(s) resulted in a   probability as opposed to a mere possibility of significant bodily injury, then   you may find that he/she/they acted under circumstances manifesting extreme   indifference to the value of human life.2 In determining whether the   defendant(s) acted purposely or knowingly or acted recklessly under   circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, you   may consider the nature of the       (NOTE: When the actual victim is one other   than the intended victim, the jury should be instructed that it is immaterial   that the actual victim was not the intended victim). If you find that the State   has proved each element beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the   defendant(s) guilty. If you find that the State has failed to prove any element   beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant(s) not guilty of the   charge of aggravated assault in that he/she/they caused significant bodily   injury to another. As I previously instructed you, the defendant(s) can be found   guilty if he/she/they EITHER caused significant bodily injury to another OR   attempted to cause significant bodily injury to another. To find the   defendant(s) guilty of attempting to cause significant bodily injury to another,   the State must prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt: That the   defendant(s) purposely3 attempted to cause significant bodily injury to another.   If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant(s) attempted to cause   significant bodily injury, it does not matter whether such injury actually   resulted. The law provides that a person is guilty of attempt if, acting   purpos       1. Engaged in conduct that would constitute the offense if the   attendant circumstances were as a reasonable person woul       2. Did (or   omitted to do) anything with the purpose of causing significant bodily injury to   another without further conduct on his/her part. This means that the   defendant(s) did something designed to cause significant bodily injury without   hav       3. Did (or omitted to do) anything that, under the circumstances as a   reasonable personwould believe them to be, was an act (or omission) constituting   a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his/her   commission of the crime. The step taken must be one that is strongly   corroborative of the defendants criminal purpose. The accused must be shown to   have had a firmness of criminal purpose in light of the step(s) he/she had   already taken. These preparatory steps must be substantial and not just very   remote preparatory acts.4 Significant bodily injury means bodily injury which   creates a temporary loss of the function of any bodily member or organ or   temporary loss of any one of the five senses. As you know, the five senses are   sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell. A person acts purposely with respect to   the result of his/her conduct if it is his/her conscious object to cause such a   result. A person acts purposely if he/she acts with design, with a specific   intent, with a particular object or purpose, or if the he/she means to do what   he/she does (e.g., &quot;I did it on purpose&quot;). If you find that the State has proved   beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant(s) attempted to cause significant   bodily injury to another, the you must find the defendant(s) guilty.5 If you   find that the State has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the   defendant(s) attempted to cause significant bodily injury to another, then you   must find the defendant(s) notguilty.6</p>
<p>1 N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1b(7) took effect on January 5, 1996.</p>
<p>2 In State v. Curtis, 195 N.J.Super. 354, 364-365 (App. Div. 1984), certif.   den., 99 N.J. 212 (1984), the Court found, in the context of aggravated   manslaughter, that the difference between recklessness under circumstances   manifesting extreme indifference to human life and mere recklessness is the   difference between the probability as opposed to the possibility that a certain   result will occur. The Supreme Court endorsed Curtis in State v. Breakiron, 108   N.J. 591, 605 (1987). The caselaw has applied the Curtis probability standard to   the aggravated-assault statute. State v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 272 (App.   Div. 1994), certif. den., 140 N.J. 276 (1995); State v. Oriole, 243 N.J. Super.   688, 693 (Law Div. 1990). Please note that in the aggravated-assault statute the   Legislature has used the term &quot;extreme indifference to the value of human life,&quot;   while the aggravated-manslaughter statute speaks in terms of &quot;extreme   indifference to human life.&quot; Therefore, the indifference referred to in the   aggravated-assault statute would appear not to relate to whether the victim   lives or dies but rather to the value of the victims life.</p>
<p>3 When a person actually causes significant bodily injury, it does not matter   whether his/her mental state is purposeful, knowing or reckless (under   circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life).   When, however, the person attempts to cause, but does not cause, significant   bodily injury, he/she must act purposefully. Cf. State v. McAllister, 211 N.J.   Super. 355, 362 (App. Div. 1986).</p>
<p>4 State v. Fornino, 223 N.J. Super. 531, 538 (App. Div. 1988), certif. den.,   111 N.J. 570 (1988), cert. den. 488 U.S. 859, 109 S.Ct. 152, 102 L.Ed. 2d 123   (1988).</p>
<p>5 Where appropriate, renunciation should be charged. N.J.S.A. 2C:5-1(d).</p>
<p>6 In third degree aggravated assault cases involving the use of a deadly   weapon, it may be appropriate to instruct the jury on the following lesser   offenses: fourth degree aggravated assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1b(3); and simple   assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1a(1) and (2). Cf. State v. Villar, 292 N.J. Super. 320,   326-330 (App. Div. 1996), revd. o.g., 150 N.J. 503, 517 n. 4 (1997). See also,   State v. Sloane, 111 N.J. 293, 301 (1988). These may be charged as lesser   offenses even though fourth degree aggravated assault and a(2) disorderly   persons simple assault contain an element (a deadly weapon) that is not an   element of third degree aggravated assault. Cf. State v. Villar, supra; State v.   Sloane, supra. When these lesser offenses are to be charged, the trial court and   counsel should construct a sequence of the lesser offenses to be charged. State   v. Villar, 150 N.J. at 517 n. 4.</p>
