<p>Grounds For Divorce Under NJ laws a divorce may be granted for any of the   following causes:</p>
<p>Adultery</p>
<p>Willful and continued desertion for 12 or more months, either physical   desertion or refusal to have sexual relations with the other spouse may   establish this cause.</p>
<p>Extreme cruelty, including any physical or mental cruelty that endangers your   safety or health, or which makes continued living together improper or   unreasonable.</p>
<p>Separation, if separate and different places of living have been maintained   for a least 18 consecutive months or more and there is no reasonable prospect of   reconciliation.</p>
<p>&quot;No-Fault&quot; is the familiar term for a divorce based on the separation for at   least 18 months. Neither side needs to set forth allegations of fault or abuse.   Court appearances are still required.</p>
<p>Voluntarily-induced addiction or habituation to a narcotic drug or habitual   drunkenness for 12 or more consecutive months.</p>
<p>Mental illness which resulted in the spouse being kept in an institution for   24 or more</p>
<p>consecutive months after the marriage was begun.</p>
<p>Imprisonment of the spouse for 18 or more consecutive months after the   marriage was begun. ( This cause for divorce can be charged after the defendants   release from prison only if the husband and wife have not resumed living   together after imprisonment ended.)</p>
<p>Deviant sexual conduct voluntarily performed by the defendant without the   consent of the spouse.</p>
<p>Is there a &quot;legal separation?&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, there is no such thing in New Jersey as a &quot;legal separation.&quot;   Separation simply means that you and your spouse no longer live together.   Separation may occur by mutual consent or by one of you leaving or being   expelled from your home.</p>
<p>What if my spouse has physically abused me?</p>
<p>If there has been actual or threatened physical abuse, your spouse may be   ordered by the court to leave your residence and to stay away.</p>
<p>Filing For Divorce</p>
<p>A formal written document called a &quot;complaint&quot; will be prepared by your   attorney based upon the information you have supplied. You must sign a statement   to verify that the information in the complaint dealing with marriage,   residency, children and grounds for divorce are true.</p>
<p>The complaint is filed with the Superior Court of New Jersey, Family Part. A   copy of the complaint must then be served on your spouse, either by the County   Sheriff, by mail or in person. The attorney for the defendant spouse may accept   service of the complaint in lieu of the sheriff serving the complaint.</p>
<p>What The Defendant Spouse Must Do</p>
<p>If served with a Complaint or demand letter from an attorney, you should   immediately consult an attorney for advice. If you contest any of the statements   in the complaint, you must have a formal pleading called an &quot;answer&quot; filed on   your behalf. You can contest alimony, custody, child support and/or equitable   distribution of property. You can also file your own complaint called a   &quot;Counter-Claim.&quot; Even if you do not object to the divorce, you should speak with   your attorney because other issues could effect you for many years in the   future. If an answer is not filed, a default will be entered against you and a   judge will make a decision without your opinion. Thereafter, you will bound by   the decision of the judge. Failure to obey all portions of the court order can   result in financial penalties and arrest.</p>
<p>Case Information Statement</p>
<p>If child support, alimony and equitable distribution are in issue, both   spouses must fill out a Case Information Statement (CIS). This demands   comprehensive information regarding your weekly, prior year and current assets,   and liabilities. The court will use financial information contained in the CIS   to make a determination as to the amount of child support.</p>
<p>Litigation</p>
<p>In addition to the CIS, in a contested matter, Court rules permit the   attorneys to require the parties to supply written answers to interrogatories   (questions), depositions, (verbal answers), produce documents or admit   details.</p>
<p>How Long Does It Take</p>
<p>When the divorce will be granted depends on many details. The more you and   your spouse can agree upon, the faster your case can move along. There is a   substantial backlog of cases that is beyond the control of your attorney. In an   uncontested divorce, where all issues are agreed upon, Final Divorce hearing and   divorce could be granted within a few months of filing the complaint. If any   issues are contested and cant be settled, a trial and final decision could take   years.</p>
<p>Property Settlement Agreement</p>
<p>The parties may agree on signing a written agreement dividing marital   property and setting forth support payments. A written agreement can be made   prior to the complaint or pending trial. The agreement can provide for custody,   visitation, alimony, medical expenses and insurance coverage.</p>
<p>After a husband and wife separate, and especially if they intend to divorce,   it is desirable for them to enter into a written contract to provide for:   division of real estate and personal property; support, if any, payable to the   dependent spouse and children; responsibility for debts and legal fees; health   and life insurance arrangements; custody and visitation of children.</p>
<p>Also included are many other items which set forth the mutual rights and   duties of the two people. Such an agreement is a contract, but may be enforced   as though it is an order of court, (except certain portions such as child   custody, support and visitation, which may be modified by the Court), depending   on its terms and contents. It is written by your attorneys and follows   negotiations between you and your spouse and your attorneys.</p>
<p>Child Support</p>
<p>The judge will follow written guidelines when determining child support. The   judge will look at the income of both parties and make an order compelling child   support within the guidelines. The judge could also order medical and dental   insurance, the payment of day-care and baby-sitting, private school tuition, and   life insurance on each parents life with the child as the beneficiary. The court   may also order payment of future college tuition.</p>
<p>Who is responsible for the support of the children?</p>
<p>The law imposes a duty on both parents to support their children. This   obligation exist even if the parents are not married, and it continues after   divorce. In determining the amount of child support to be paid by one parent to   the other, the court will consider the respective incomes, earning capacities,   assets and needs of both parents, and the needs of the children. The Judge has a   &quot;chart&quot; in which he must follow to determine the amount of support that can be   compelled.</p>
<p>What is the procedure for obtaining spouse and child support?</p>
<p>A person seeking spouse and/or child support may file a motion for support in   the Family Court, in many cases and in all cases involving welfare, a conference   will be held by a hearing officer at which both parties will be required to   disclose their respective incomes and assets and prove their respective needs.   An attempt will be made by the hearing officer to have the parties reach an   agreement as to the amount of support. If an agreement cannot be reached, the   usual procedure is for the hearing officer to submit a recommendation to the   court.</p>
<p>If either party is not satisfied with the recommendation, he or she may   demand a hearing before the court at which the order could be modified. If both   parties are satisfied with the order entered by the court on the hearing   officers recommendation, it will be the final order.</p>
<p>Can a support order be changed?</p>
<p>Either spouse or parent may seek modification (increase or reduction) of a   support order if he or she can demonstrate that a material and substantial   change of circumstances has taken place since the order was entered. An increase   or decrease in earnings or an increase in the needs of the children as they grow   older are examples of material and substantial changes in circumstances. Once a   child reaches age 18, and is out of school the parents generally are no longer   required to support that child. A motion must be made in the Superior Court to   reduce or end support. However, if the child is unable to support himself or   herself because of some physical, mental or emotional disability, the duty of   support continues beyond 18. Parents may also be required to pay support to a   child who is attending college.</p>
<p>Custody And Visitation</p>
<p>The &quot;best interest of the child&quot; is the basis on how the judge awards custody   of the child. The mother is no longer automatically given custody of the   children. The judge looks at the age and sex of the child, ability of the parent   to care for the child, personal relationships and, if older, the wishes of the   child. Visitation will also be ordered under most circumstances. An equal   sharing of physical custody of children is also possible in appropriate   cases.</p>
<p>As children get older, greater weight is given by the court to the childs   preference as to which parent he or she wishes to reside. An important factor   considered by the court is the continued residency of children in a familiar and   stable home environment.</p>
<p>Courts are reluctant to disturbance existing arrangement if the children are   doing well. The courts are also reluctant to split children between two parents   because courts believe that it is in the best interest of brothers and sisters   to remain together even though their parents have separated or are divorced.</p>
<p>Equitable Distribution</p>
<p>Most parties eventually reach an agreement to divide property. In New Jersey,   each spouse is entitled to a share of the property acquired during the marriage.   There is not an automatic 50/50 split. Rather, the judge will make an &quot;equitable   distribution&quot; of property after hearing testimony. There is no magic formula.   The judge has discretion.</p>
<p>Final Judgment</p>
<p>Upon agreement or after a trial, the judge will enter a &quot;Final Judgment of   Divorce&quot;. This will declare that the marriage has ended. The judge will sign the   Final Judgment of Divorce and it will be filed with the Superior Court in   Trenton.</p>
<p>The Final Judgment will also set forth items agreed upon or ordered, such as   custody, support, and equitable distribution. After the Divorce, to make a   change in support, custody, visitation etc, a formal motion must be made to the   Superior Court. In this motion you must demonstrate a change in   circumstances.</p>
