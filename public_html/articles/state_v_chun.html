  HOENS, J., writing for the   Court.<br />
  In this case, the Court addresses the scientific reliability of the   Alcotest 7110 MKIII-C evidentiary breath-
  testing device (Alcotest) and   considers the admissibility of the Alcohol Influence Reports (AIRs) that it   generates
  for the prosecution of defendants under New Jersey drunk driving   laws.<br />
  Defendants are twenty individuals charged with driving while   intoxicated, N.J.S.A. 39:4-50, in Middlesex
  County, who challenged the   admissibility of Alcotest results in their individual proceedings. The Law   Division
  consolidated the cases to consider the reliability of the device.   The State filed a motion requesting that the device be
  recognized as   scientifically reliable. The Law Division denied that motion, and the State   filed an interlocutory
  appeal. The Appellate Division remanded the matter,   but before that proceeding could continue, the Court directly
  certified the   appeal pursuant to Rule 2:12-1 on December 14, 2005.<br />
  The Court remanded the   case to retired Appellate Division Judge Michael Patrick King, sitting as a   Special
  Master, to conduct a hearing on the overall scientific reliability of   the Alcotest. Following four months of
  testimony, the Special Master issued a   report on February 13, 2007. He concluded that the device was   scientifically
  reliable, conditioned on specific modifications and   recommendations. After that report was issued, but before oral<br />
  arguments were   heard, the manufacturer of the device, Draeger Safety Diagnostics (Draeger),   moved for leave to
  intervene, which motion the Court granted on March 27,   2007. Following oral arguments, the Court again remanded
  the matter to the   Special Master, this time to afford defendants an opportunity, following   Draeger&rsquo;s intervention, to
  examine the source code that comprises the   Alcotest software. After receipt of experts&rsquo; reports and further
  testimony,   the Special Master issued a supplemental report on November 8, 2007, in which he   affirmed his original
  finding of scientific reliability, contingent on   several additional recommendations. Thereafter, the Court conducted
  a second   round of oral arguments.
  Three distinct sets of challenges were raised   regarding the use of Alcotest results in drunk driving
  prosecutions. The   first set of challenges related to how the machine measures a suspect&rsquo;s blood   alcohol
  concentration (BAC). It was contested whether: (1) the Alcotest&rsquo;s use   of a 2100 to 1 blood/breath ratio is unreliable
  because it overestimates the   actual BAC of some individuals; (2) to avoid equal protection issues, all   suspects,
  instead of just women over the age of sixty, should be held to a   minimum breath sample volume requirement of 1.2
  liters of air; (3) a breath   temperature sensor is necessary because the machine may overestimate the BAC of   exhaled
  breath above a certain temperature; (4) the machine&rsquo;s tolerance,   which is the deviation range within which test
  measurements must fall to   constitute a reliable result, is acceptable.<br />
  The next set of challenges   related to the Alcotest&rsquo;s programming and source code. Defendants argued   that:
(1) the use of an algorithm to compensate for the depletion or &ldquo;drift&rdquo;   of fuel cells artificially inflates results; (2) the
  use of a &ldquo;weighted   averaging&rdquo; algorithm, which places greater weight on later breath measurements   than earlier
  ones, also serves to artificially inflate results; (3) a buffer   overflow error undermines the reliability of Alcotest
  results in certain   circumstances; (4) the lack of catastrophic error detection within the device   undermines the
  reliability of its results; and (5) the overall programming   style fails to follow any design standard, and is so flawed
  that it can not   be relied on to produce accurate results.
  The third set of challenges related   to the admissibility of Alcotest results and foundational documents   as
  potentially violating Sixth Amendment rights under Crawford v.   Washington.<br />
  <br />
  
  HELD: The Court adopts, as modified, the Special   Master&rsquo;s reports and recommendations. Subject to certain
  conditions, the   Court holds that the Alcotest is scientifically reliable and that its results   are admissible in drunk
  driving prosecutions. The Court contemporaneously   issues an Order vacating its January 10, 2006, stay of drunk
  driving   prosecutions, appeals, and sentencing, which shall proceed in accordance with   the directives set forth
  therein.<br />
  1.
  There is sufficient credible   evidence to support the continued use of a 2100 to 1 blood/breath alcohol   ratio
  to estimate BAC from a breath sample. The overwhelming evidence   demonstrates that use of this ratio tends to
  underestimate the actual BAC in   the vast majority of persons whose breath is tested. Although there may be a   small
  number of individuals who are disadvantaged by a device that uses the   2100 to 1 blood/breath ratio, there is sound
  scientific support for its   continued utilization. (pp. 49-52)<br />
  2.
  The four criteria used by the device   to identify a valid breath sample are, with one modification,
  appropriate.   The Court adopts the recommendation that the minimum breath volume requirement   should be
  lowered, for women over sixty years of age only, from 1.5 liters to   1.2 liters and concludes that this modification<br />
  does not violate equal   protection rights. Regardless of minimum breath requirements, no test will be   accepted by the
  machine until the infrared measurement plateaus, which only   occurs when a suspect is expelling deep lung air.
  Further, while selectively   lowering the breath volume requirement will create a different level at which   women over
  sixty may be charged with refusal, the record demonstrates that   this group, and only this group, may not have the
  physiological capability of   providing a larger sample. In pending prosecutions, and in future prosecutions   based on
  tests conducted prior to the implementation of the Court&rsquo;s   directives, an Alcotest AIR with an insufficient volume
  error message may not   be used as evidence of refusal against women over the age of sixty, unless they   also provided
  another sample of at least 1.5 liters. (pp. 52-65)<br />
  3.
  The   Court declines to adopt the recommendation that a breath temperature sensor be   added to the Alcotest,
  concluding that this device is both unnecessary and   impractical. The record includes scant evidence of a correlation
  between   breath temperature and increased breath alcohol concentration, and no evidence   that the theoretical increase
  in breath alcohol concentration would translate   into an inaccurately elevated BAC. Further, any potential effect   is
  ameliorated by the 2100 to 1 blood/breath ratio and by use of truncated,   rather than rounded, results, both of which
  serve to underestimate results.   Requiring the addition of a breath temperature sensor would also present   an
  unreasonable maintenance burden on New Jersey&rsquo;s breath testing program.   (pp. 65-71)<br />
  4.
  A tolerance range of an absolute 0.01 percent (plus or   minus 0.005 percent from the mean) BAC standard,
  coupled with the use of a   like percentage range of tolerance expressed as five percent plus or minus   deviation from
  the mean, is both scientifically appropriate and consistent   with the intention of the legislature in adopting per se
  limits. The device   must therefore be reprogrammed to comply with this standard. In pending   prosecutions, and in
  future prosecutions based on tests conducted prior to   the implementation of the Court&rsquo;s directives, in which the AIR
  reports a BAC   obtained using a doubled tolerance range, the reported breath samples must be   reviewed to determine
  whether the results meet this tolerance range. Any AIR   that does not include two valid tests within tolerance under
  this standard   cannot be deemed to be sufficiently scientifically reliable to be admissible and   shall not be admitted
  into evidence as proof of a per se violation. (pp.   71-88)<br />
  5.
  The Alcotest&rsquo;s use of the fuel cell &ldquo;drift&rdquo; algorithm does not   undermine its reliability. Scientific evidence
  demonstrates that fuel cells   begin to age as soon as they are put into service, and will eventually cause the   Alcotest&rsquo;s
  electric chemical test to underestimate BAC. While there may be   other means to compensate for this &ldquo;drift,&rdquo; those
  means would not, in the   end, be any more advantageous to defendants than the minor upward adjustment   that the
  algorithm effects. However, the Court adopts the Special Master&rsquo;s   recommendation that the devices be recalibrated
  semi-annually instead of   annually. A semi-annual calibration is consistent with the   manufacturer&rsquo;s
  recommendations and provides a useful safeguard by affording a   more regular opportunity to evaluate and replace
  aging fuel cells. (pp.   89-95)<br />
  6.
  The Court concludes that the Alcotest&rsquo;s &ldquo;weighted averaging&rdquo;   algorithm is an appropriate calculation that
  results in a more accurate   infrared measurement. It gives greater weight to the breath that, inevitably,   includes the
  deepest air drawn from the lungs. It therefore focuses the   analysis on the portion of the breath sample that most
  accurately represents   the subject&rsquo;s BAC. (pp. 95-96)<br />
  7.
  The buffer overflow error   is a real error in the programming that may cause the Alcotest to report   incorrect
  results in situations involving a third breath sample, which is   taken only when the measurements from the first two
  tests are not in   tolerance. The buffer overflow programming error, which must be corrected,   affects only the final
  BAC result reported on the AIR. Because the infrared   and electric chemical measurements for all of the test
  samples are accurately   reported on the AIR, the correct BAC value can, and must, be computed from   those
  measurements by applying a corrective formula. In pending prosecutions,   and in future prosecutions based on tests
  conducted prior to the   implementation of the Court&rsquo;s directives, the State must review all AIRs that   include three
  tests, perform the calculations to identify the correct BAC in   accordance with the corrective formula, and provide
  that data to the court.   The calculations must be made a part of the evidence in any prosecution to   facilitate appellate
  review. (pp. 96-102)<br />
  8.
  The Court finds adequate   support in the record that catastrophic error detection should be re-enabled in   the
  Alcotest. This detection will allow the machine to recognize catastrophic   errors and respond by shutting down.
  There is no basis for the Court to   conclude that the lack of catastrophic error detection could result in an   inaccurate
  AIR in any pending prosecution. (pp. 102-103)<br />
  9.
  The Court   finds the overall programming style and design of the source code to be   acceptable. The
  exhaustive review undertaken in this case revealed few actual   errors or issues within the source code. There being
  no evidence in the   record that any other asserted shortcomings are more than stylistic or   theoretical challenges, the
  Court declines to require any specific   programming standards at this time. (pp. 104-105)<br />
  10.
  In future revisions   to the Alcotest software, the State must: have the Alcotest software locked so   that only
  the manufacturer can make revisions to the source code; have the   software revised so that the Alcotest identifies and
  prints the software   version that it is utilizing on each AIR; and give detailed notice consistent   with due process to the
  public and the New Jersey State Bar Association of   any future revisions. (pp. 105-107)<br />
  11.
  Draeger must make Alcotest   training, comparable to that provided to the State, available to licensed   New
  Jersey attorneys and their experts at reasonable times and locations   within New Jersey and at a reasonable cost. (p.
  108)<br />
  12.
  The twelve   foundational documents identified by the Special Master must be provided during   discovery in
  all matters. The operator of the device shall be available to   testify and shall produce evidence of his qualifications to
  operate the   device. The following foundational documents, evidencing the good working order   of the machine, shall
  be admitted into evidence in prosecutions based on   Alcotest breath testing results: the most recent calibration
  report,   including control tests, linearity tests, and the credentials of the coordinator   who performed the calibration;
  the most recent new standard solution report   prior to a defendant&rsquo;s test; and the certificate of analysis of the   0.10
  simulator solution used in a defendant&rsquo;s control tests. These   foundational documents are not &ldquo;testimonial,&rdquo; as
  defined by the United States   Supreme Court in Crawford v. Washington and its progeny. In so holding, the   Court
  aligns itself with the majority of other courts, which have found that   such documents are business records, which do
  not implicate the Confrontation   Clause. (pp. 108-125)<br />
  13.
  The AIR itself, a &ldquo;statement&rdquo; of a machine, is   not testimonial under Crawford because it does not implicate
  Crawford&rsquo;s core   concerns -- it is not a report of a past event, given in response to police   interrogation, with the
  purpose of establishing evidence that a defendant   committed an offense. Although the AIR is not testimonial
  evidence, the Court   nevertheless mandates various safeguards to protect a defendant&rsquo;s due process   rights: the<br />
  opportunity to cross-examine the operator of the Alcotest, the   routine production of all foundational documents in
  discovery, and the   admission of the core foundational documents into evidence at trial. (pp.   125-130)</p>
