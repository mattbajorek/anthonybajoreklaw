<p>39:3-40 Driving on a Suspended License in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Thousands of motorists in New Jersey are stopped for routine traffic   violations then are surprised to be informed their license is suspended. Where   the minimum costs would be over $1,261 in fines, surcharge and costs, motorists   should be certain not to allow their license to become suspended. If charged,   motorists may need an attorney with knowledge and skill in handling driving   while suspended matters.</p>
<p>The violation of Driving While Suspended is set forth at NJSA 39:3-40. This   section states, no person to whom a drivers license has been refused or whose   drivers license or reciprocity privilege has been suspended or revoked or who   has been prohibited from obtaining a drivers license, shall personally operate a   motor vehicle during the period of refusal suspension, revocation or   prohibition. The statute also prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle whose   registration has been revoked.</p>
<p><strong>PENALTIES</strong></p>
<p>Conviction under this statute brings the following penalties. Upon conviction   of the first offense of fine of $500.00. The defendant will also be surcharged a   mandatory $250.00 per year for 3 years in every DWS by the DMV. Upon conviction   for the second offense a fine of $750.00 and imprisonment in the county jail for   not more than 5 days. Upon conviction for the third offense a fine of $1000.00   and imprisonment in the county jail for 10 days. Additionally, the statute   states, upon the conviction the court shall impose or extend a period of   suspension not to exceed 6 months. Also, upon conviction the court shall impose   a period of imprisonment for not less than 45 days, if while operating a vehicle   in violation of this section a person is involved in an accident resulting in   personal injury to another person.</p>
<p>If an individual violates this section while under suspension issued pursuant   to 39:4-50, driving while under the influence of liquor or drugs and is   convicted, they shall be fined $500.00 extra? and have their license suspended   for an additional period not less than one year nor more than two years and may   be in the county jail for not more than 90 days. The defendant will also be   surcharged a mandatory $250.00 per year for 3 years.</p>
<p>Although most municipal court matters are considered minor by many citizens   it is obvious from the possible penalties involved that this is a serious   offense carrying the possibility of both stiff fines and incarceration.</p>
<p>There are two types of license suspension :</p>
<p>1. Court imposed suspension</p>
<p>2. Administrative / Division of Motor Vehicles suspension</p>
<p>The most common scenario reflects where that the driver, through a motor   vehicle violation, failure to pay surcharge or a accumulated points has been   placed on a suspended list maintained by the New Jersey Division of Motor   Vehicles (Division of Motor Vehicles), thereby making them ineligible to operate   a motor vehicle for a prescribed period of time in this state.</p>
<p>If the driver is aware that they are on the suspended list and acknowledged   they were suspended to the police officer there is little room for defense   However, more often than not the driver claims that they were unaware of their   placement on the suspension list.</p>
<p>The scenario that will often be presented by the driver is that he/she was   stopped by police for an unrelated motor vehicle violation. In the process of   the police encounter they were informed by the officer that their license has   been suspended and they were issued an additional summons for Driving While   Suspended. Over the past decade several New Jersey cases have crafted the   current position on the driving while suspended issue that often confronts many   municipal courts throughout the state.</p>
<p><strong>THE STATE MUST SHOW DUE PROCESS AND ADEQUATE NOTICE</strong></p>
<p>The first and foremost is that of adequate notice of the suspension. In   Parsekian v. Cresse, 75 N.J. Super. 405 (App Div. 1962), the court ruled that it   was incumbent upon the Director of the State Division of Motor Vehicles to   provide fair and adequate notice to the licensed driver of the proposed   suspension of their license. The court recognized that the Director could not   arbitrarily suspend the license of a driver without providing both notice and   enunciating specific reasons as to why the license was being suspended.</p>
<p>A later case, State v. Wenof, 102 N.J. Super. (Law Div. 1968), both   reinforced and advanced the earlier Parsekian decision. Wenof represents the   substantive foundation upon which all subsequent cases involving the notice   issue have been based. In Wenof, the court again recognized the importance of   adequate notice of suspension. The court related, there is always a risk that   notice may not reach the intended person, but this is not the test for legal   sufficiency. The test is rather, whether the notice was reasonably calculated to   reach the intended parties. Id at 375. In Wenof, the Division of Motor Vehicles   sent to a written notice of proposed suspension (for failure to satisfy a   summons) by regular mail. The Division of Motor Vehicles thereafter sent an   order of suspension by ordinary mail. The notices were mailed to the defendants   last address. By failing to leave a forwarding address informing the Division of   Motor Vehicles where he could be reached by mail, the court stated he should not   be heard to complain of lack of due process He had it. The court found the   defendant guilty.</p>
<p>In State v. Hammond 116 N.J. Super. 244 (Cty. Ct. 1971) a notice of scheduled   suspension and order of suspension for failure to appear for motor vehicle   violations was mailed to defendant, but was returned undelivered to Division of   Motor Vehicles by postal authorities. The defendant was charged with   misstatement of fact in an application for registration of a motor vehicle   (39:3-37) and application for a registration certificate during suspension   (39:3-34). The defendant thereafter applied for and obtained a New Jersey   registration certificate for vehicle.</p>
<p>While in State v. Wenof supra the defendant was found guilty that case was   distinguished in Ha mmond. In Hammond there was insufficient evidence of any   notice to Hammond of a possible revocation of his registration certificate.   Therefore, there is no adequate proof to indicate that due process was satisfied   in this case. Hammond, 116 N.J. Super. at 248.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE BY IN-COURT SUSPENSION</strong></p>
<p>If the driver is on the suspension list because he was suspended in a   Courtroom for a prior violation, grounds to defend are very limited. The most   common violations which carry mandatory suspensions on first offense by the   Municipal Courts are for driving while intoxicated (first offense 6-12 months),   driving while suspended (up to 6 months), driving without insurance (1 year),   possession of Marijuana or paraphernalia (6 months-2 years). A Municipal Court   also has the power to suspend a drivers license for driving while suspended,   reckless driving, excessive speeding, leaving the scene of an accident or even   where the judge finds a person guilty of such a willful violation of the   subtitle as shall in the courts discretion, justify such revocation   (39:5-31).</p>
<p>If the drivers license was suspended by a court, the state in a subsequent   Driving While Suspended needs to introduce into evidence only a certified   abstract from the Division of Motor Vehicles. It is not necessary for the state   to demonstrate that notice was received by the defendant. The defense may still   challenge the suspension by introducing evidence that the prior in-court   suspension was improper. Examples include defendant not notified to be in court   and the court then acting without the defendant being present. Possibly, the   prior suspension could be attached in the original court as being illegal and/or   unconstitutional. This is permitted under State v. Laurick. 120 NJ 1 (1990)</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE BY Division of Motor Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>Where the driver was suspended by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the state   must introduce</p>
<ol>
  <li>Notice of scheduled suspension. </li>
  <li>Proof of mailing notice. </li>
  <li>Order of suspension. </li>
  <li>Proof of mailing order. </li>
  <li>Certified motor vehicle abstract. </li>
</ol>
<p>A certified abstract alone is not sufficient to convict if the defendant was   suspended only by the Division of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>If the order of suspension was mailed on December 1, 1991 and the Driving   While Suspended offense took place December 2, 1991, a good defense is that the   Order did not reach his house until after the ticket for Driving While   Suspended.</p>
<p>Many suspensions today are because people forgot to pay an insurance   surcharge. Every insurance surcharge bill serves as a notice of suspension.   Indigency is not a defense for failure to pay a surcharge.</p>
<p><strong>DEFENSES</strong></p>
<p>A valid suspension of a drivers license cannot be effectuated in the absence   of a written notice to the license at his last known address, reciting the fact   that the suspension will take place and the date of commencement of the   suspension. State v. Kindler 191 N.J. Super. 358,360 (Law Div 1983). Failure to   appear for a summons is not a substitute for the written notice required by the   statute, Id at 361. The court also noted that its research does not statutory   revealing authority for the Municipal Judge to suspend driving privileges. Id at   362</p>
<p>Motorists suspended for any reason remains suspended until they pay a $50.00   Division of Motor Vehicles restoration fee. According to the harsh decision in   State v. Zalta 217 N.J. Super. 142 (Law Div. 1987) even if a prior court imposed   suspension is over 6 months on DWI, the suspension continues until actual   restoration of the license.</p>
<p>Plea bargaining is permitted in Driving While Suspended matters. Many court   adhere to the language of State v. Somma 215 N.J. Super. 142 (Law Div 1986)   where the court determined that the failure to pay the $50.00 fee for   restoration of the suspended drivers license does not extend the period of   suspension. Many times individuals are told by a court their license is   suspended for a certain number of months, but they are usually not told they   must pay a restoration fee to actually get their license back. Individuals who   pay a surcharge late will have their licenses suspended initially for the   failure to pay. Even after the surcharge is paid they remain suspended until the   $30.00 restoration fee is paid. Often, plea bargaining or alternative   dispositions can be worked out to avoid the harsh consequences of Driving While   Suspended and the equitable rationale of State v. Somma is followed.</p>
<p>Few courts inform a driver charged with Driving While Suspended that the   penalty is anything more than a $500.00 fine plus up to six months loss of   license. Most courts do not warn a defendant if he pleads guilty he will have to   pay Division of Motor Vehicles insurance surcharges or face other new   penalties.</p>
<p>Few drivers are aware of the new provisions of NJAC 11:3-34, operative date   April 1, 1991, which allows insurance companies to charge additional surcharge   to drivers. These new insurance company surcharges are in a addition to Division   of Motor Vehicles surcharges and fines. Several non MTF insurance companies have   already received approval to charge between $37.00 and $218.00 for each point a   driver accumulates. For Driving While Suspended pursuant to 2C N.J.R. 576 a   driver is given 9 Automobile Eligibility Points.</p>
<p>Hundreds of drivers in 1992 with be in for a rude awakening when they   discover they were dropped by their personal carrier, sent to the MTF and have   to pay substantial additional carrier surcharges on top of Division of Motor   Vehicles surcharges.</p>
<p>Given the difficult economic times and high cost of insurance, many drivers   simply cant afford to both drive to work and pay for insurance. These drivers   will often get caught driving without insurance. The mandatory suspension for   this violation will be putting hundreds of drivers on the ever increasing   suspension list.</p>
<p><strong>PARKING ADJUDICATION ACT OFFENDER</strong></p>
<p>Scofflaws who took their parking tickets and threw them away or forgot to pay   tickets will now have these licenses eventually suspended under the Parking   Offense Adjudication Act. (NJSA 39:4-139.2). If a person fails to appear or pay   for a ticket, the court may give notice to the vehicle owner that the failure to   appear or pay will result in suspension of drivers license. Pursuant to NJSA   39:4-139.10(b) the judge or the Division of Motor Vehicles may now suspend the   drivers license of on owner license or operator who has not answered or appeared   in response to a failure to appear notice or has not paid or otherwise satisfied   outstanding parking from penalties.</p>
<p><strong>CONTESTING PROPOSED ADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSIONS</strong></p>
<p>The DMV, prior to suspending a license, or taking specific actionagainst a   driver must mail a notice to the driver informing them of the proposed   suspension or other action. The proposed action to be taken against any licensee   by the DMV becomes effective on the date set forth on the notice except when   otherwise specified, unless the licenses or his/her attorney shall make a   request, in writing, for a hearing within 25 days from the date of notice. New   Jersey Administrative Code (NJAC)13:19-1.2.</p>
<p>NJAC 13:19-1.2 requires the request for a hearing to set forth all disputed   facts, legal issues and arguments. Under NJAC 13:19-1.2, the DMV may either deny   the request for a hearing, require a prehearing conference with a DMV employee,   or transmit of the matter to the Office of Administrative Law for a hearing   pursuant to NJAC 1:1.</p>
<p>The DMV employee who conducts the prehearing is referred to as a driver   improvement specialist. Often a resolution of the proposed administrative action   is reached between the DMV and the licensee (ie- reduce suspension period -ex   180 days to 100 days).</p>
<p>If the license except the resolution of the proposed administrative action,   the license is to have abandoned any further opportunity to be heard</p>
<p><strong>NJAC 13:19-1.8(c).</strong></p>
<p>If the parties cannot reach a resolution, the matter should be submitted to   the office of Administrative Law for a hearing NJAC 13:19-1.8(d)</p>
<p><strong>ENHANCED PENALTIES</strong></p>
<p>As set forth previously, the Driving While Suspended calls for mandatory   enhanced penalties on conviction second and third offense. What counts as an   offense? Both the Division of Motor Vehicles and a court can suspend a driver   for driving while suspended.</p>
<p>In State vs. Conte, 245 NJ Super. 629 (Law Div. 1990) the court examined a   case where a defendant driver had two prior administrative suspensions by the   DMV pursuant to NJSA 39:5-30 and NJAC 13:19-10.8. The driver had no prior court   imposed convictions.</p>
<p>NJSA 39:3-40 provides for penalties upon conviction. In a well reasoned   opinion by Judge Robert Longhi, on trial de novo, the court stated:</p>
<p>The word conviction is not defined in the statute. Blacks Law Dictionary   defines conviction as the final judgment in a verdict or finding of guilty...   Blacks Law Dictionary (6 ed. 1990) at 333. NJSA 2C:44-4(a) defines prior   conviction of an offense as an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction   that the defendant committed an offense constitutes a prior conviction, Emphasis   supplied. Conviction has also been defined as the confession of the accused in   open court or the verdict returned by the jury which ascertains and publishes   the fact of guilt. Tucker vs. Tucker, 101 NJ Eq. 72, 73, 137 A. 40 (Ch.   1927).</p>
<p>The motor vehicle statute, NJSA 39:3-40, is quasi-criminal and penal in   nature and must be strictly construed against the State. State vs.   Churchdale-Leasing Inc., 115 N.J. 83, 102, 557 A. 2d 277 (1989). The word   conviction, as it is used in NJSA 39:3-40, refers only to a plea or a finding of   guilty in a court of competent jurisdiction and not an order of suspension   entered by the DMV as the result of an administrative proceeding. The two prior   suspensions are not convictions and defendant must be viewed as a first offender   under the statute.</p>
<p>State vs. Conte, 245 N.J. Super. at 631</p>
<p>The sentence imposed was reversed and the matter remanded for sentencing as a   first offender.</p>
