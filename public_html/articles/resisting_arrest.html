<p align="center">
<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC represents individuals charged with criminal and serious traffic violations   throughout New Jersey.</p>
<p>2C:29-2. Resisting Arrest; Eluding Officer. a. (1) Except as provided in   paragraph (3), a person is guilty of a disorderly persons offense if he   purposely prevents or attempts to prevent a law enforcement officer from   effecting an arrest. (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), a person is guilty   of a crime of the fourth degree if he, by flight, purposely prevents or attempts   to prevent a law enforcement officer from effecting an arrest. (3) An offense   under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection a. is a crime of the third degree if   the person:</p>
<p>(a)Uses or threatens to use physical force or violence against the law   enforcement officer or another; or</p>
<p>(b)Uses any other means to create a substantial risk of causing physical   injury to the public servant or another.</p>
<p>It is not a defense to a prosecution under this subsection that the law   enforcement officer was acting unlawfully in making the arrest, provided he was   acting under color of his official authority and provided the law enforcement   officer announces his intention to arrest prior to the resistance.</p>
<p>b.Any person, while operating a motor vehicle on any street or highway in   this State or any vessel, as defined pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1995, c.401   (C.12:7-71), on the waters of this State, who knowingly flees or attempts to   elude any police or law enforcement officer after having received any signal   from such officer to bring the vehicle or vessel to a full stop commits a crime   of the third degree; except that, a person is guilty of a crime of the second   degree if the flight or attempt to elude creates a risk of death or injury to   any person. For purposes of this subsection, there shall be a permissive   inference that the flight or attempt to elude creates a risk of death or injury   to any person if the persons conduct involves a violation of chapter 4 of Title   39 or chapter 7 of Title 12 of the Revised Statutes. In addition to the penalty   prescribed under this subsection or any other section of law, the court shall   order the suspension of that persons drivers license, or privilege to operate a   vessel, whichever is appropriate, for a period of not less than six months or   more than two years.</p>
<p>In the case of a person who is at the time of the imposition of sentence less   than 17 years of age, the period of the suspension of driving privileges   authorized herein, including a suspension of the privilege of operating a   motorized bicycle, shall commence on the day the sentence is imposed and shall   run for a period as fixed by the court. If the driving or vessel operating   privilege of any person is under revocation, suspension, or postponement for a   violation of any provision of this Title or Title 39 of the Revised Statutes at   the time of any conviction or adjudication of delinquency for a violation of any   offense defined in this chapter or chapter 36 of this Title, the revocation,   suspension, or postponement period imposed herein shall commence as of the date   of termination of the existing revocation, suspension, or postponement.</p>
<p>Upon conviction the court shall collect forthwith the New Jersey drivers   licenses of the person and forward such license or licenses to the Director of   the Division of Motor Vehicles along with a report indicating the first and last   day of the suspension or postponement period imposed by the court pursuant to   this section. If the court is for any reason unable to collect the license or   licenses of the person, the court shall cause a report of the conviction or   adjudication of delinquency to be filed with the director. That report shall   include the complete name, address, date of birth, eye color, and sex of the   person and shall indicate the first and last day of the suspension or   postponement period imposed by the court pursuant to this section. The court   shall inform the person orally and in writing that if the person is convicted of   personally operating a motor vehicle or a vessel, whichever is appropriate,   during the period of license suspension or postponement imposed pursuant to this   section the person shall, upon conviction, be subject to the penalties set forth   in R.S.39:3-40 or section 14 of P.L.1995, c.401 (C.12:7-83), whichever is   appropriate. A person shall be required to acknowledge receipt of the written   notice in writing. Failure to receive a written notice or failure to acknowledge   in writing the receipt of a written notice shall not be a defense to a   subsequent charge of violation of R.S.39:3-40 or section 14 of P.L.1995, c.401   (C.12:7-83), whichever is appropriate. If the person is the holder of a drivers   or vessel operators license from another jurisdiction, the court shall not   collect the license but shall notify the director who shall notify the   appropriate officials in the licensing jurisdiction. The court shall, however,   in accordance with the provisions of this section, revoke the persons   non-resident driving or vessel operating privileges, whichever is appropriate,   in this State.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this subsection, it shall be a rebuttable presumption   that the owner of a vehicle or vessel was the operator of the vehicle or vessel   at the time of the offense.</p>
<p>Amended 1979, c.178, s.57; 1981, c.290, s.28; 1989, c.84; 1991, c.341, s.3;   1993, c.219, s.5; 1995, c.401, s.54; 2000, c.18, s.2.</p>
<p>2C:29-3 Hindering apprehension or prosecution.</p>
<p>2C:29-3. Hindering Apprehension or Prosecution. a.A person commits an offense   if, with purpose to hinder the detention, apprehension, investigation,   prosecution, conviction or punishment of another for an offense or violation of   Title 39 of the New Jersey Statutes or a violation of chapter 33A of Title 17 of   the Revised Statutes he:</p>
<p>(1)Harbors or conceals the other;</p>
<p>(2)Provides or aids in providing a weapon, money, transportation, disguise or   other means of avoiding discovery or apprehension or effecting escape;</p>
<p>(3)Suppresses, by way of concealment or destruction, any evidence of the   crime, or tampers with a witness, informant, document or other source of   information, regardless of its admissibility in evidence, which might aid in the   discovery or apprehension of such person or in the lodging of a charge against   him;</p>
<p>(4)Warns the other of impending discovery or apprehension, except that this   paragraph does not apply to a warning given in connection with an effort to   bring another into compliance with law;</p>
<p>(5)Prevents or obstructs, by means of force, intimidation or deception,   anyone from performing an act which might aid in the discovery or apprehension   of such person or in the lodging of a charge against him;</p>
<p>(6)Aids such person to protect or expeditiously profit from an advantage   derived from such crime; or</p>
<p>(7)Gives false information to a law enforcement officer or a civil State   investigator assigned to the Office of the Insurance Fraud Prosecutor   established by section 32 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.17:33A-16).</p>
<p>The offense is a crime of the third degree if the conduct which the actor   knows has been charged or is liable to be charged against the person aided would   constitute a crime of the second degree or greater, unless the actor is a   spouse, parent or child of the person aided, in which case the offense is a   crime of the fourth degree. The offense is a crime of the fourth degree if such   conduct would constitute a crime of the third degree. Otherwise it is a   disorderly persons offense.</p>
<p>b.A person commits an offense if, with purpose to hinder his own detention,   apprehension, investigation, prosecution, conviction or punishment for an   offense or violation of Title 39 of the New Jersey Statutes or a violation of   chapter 33A of Title 17 of the Revised Statutes, he:</p>
<p>(1)Suppresses, by way of concealment or destruction, any evidence of the   crime or tampers with a document or other source of information, regardless of   its admissibility in evidence, which might aid in his discovery or apprehension   or in the lodging of a charge against him; or</p>
<p>(2)Prevents or obstructs by means of force or intimidation anyone from   performing an act which might aid in his discovery or apprehension or in the   lodging of a charge against him; or</p>
<p>(3)Prevents or obstructs by means of force, intimidation or deception any   witness or informant from providing testimony or information, regardless of its   admissibility, which might aid in his discovery or apprehension or in the   lodging of a charge against him; or</p>
<p>(4)Gives false information to a law enforcement officer or a civil State   investigator assigned to the Office of the Insurance Fraud Prosecutor   established by section 32 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.17:33A-16).</p>
<p>The offense is a crime of the third degree if the conduct which the actor   knows has been charged or is liable to be charged against him would constitute a   crime of the second degree or greater. The offense is a crime of the fourth   degree if such conduct would constitute a crime of the third degree. Otherwise   it is a disorderly persons offense.</p>
<p>Amended 1981, c.290, s.29; amended 1999, c.297.</p>
<p>If someone is indicted for the Serious criminal charge of &quot;ELUDING AN   OFFICER&quot;, the Judge will read portions of the following to the Jury:</p>
<p>(N.J.S.A. 2C:29-2b)</p>
<p>[Second and Third Degree]</p>
<p>The indictment charges the defendant with committing the crime of eluding an   officer. The indictment reads as follows:</p>
<p>(Read Indictment)</p>
<p>The statute on which this charge is based reads as follows:</p>
<p>Any person, while operating a motor vehicle on any street or highway in this   State, who knowingly flees or attempts to elude any police or law enforcement   officer after having received any signal from such officer to bring the vehicle   to a full stop commits a crime of the third degree.</p>
<p>[CHARGE FOLLOWING SENTENCE IF SUBMITTING BOTH</p>
<p>SECOND AND THIRD DEGREE]</p>
<p>[That person] is guilty of a crime of the second degree if the flight or   attempt to elude creates a risk of death or injury to any person.</p>
<p>[CHARGE FOLLOWING SENTENCE IF SUBMITTING BOTH SECOND AND THIRD DEGREE]</p>
<p>[I will ask you to consider both third degree and second degree eluding, and   will begin by defining third degree.] In order to convict the defendant of third   degree eluding, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the   following six (6) elements: 1. That was operating a motor vehicle on a street or   highway in this state. 2. That was a police or law enforcement officer. 3. That   signaled to bring the vehicle to a full stop. 4. That knew that the officer had   signaled (him/her) to bring the vehicle to a full stop. 5. That knew that was a   police or law enforcement officer. 6. That defendant knowingly fled or attempted   to elude the officer.</p>
<p>If you find that was the owner of the vehicle, you may infer that (he/she)   was operating that vehicle at the time of the offense. However, you are never   required or compelled to draw this inference. It is your exclusive province to   determine whether the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence support any   inference and you are always free to accept them or reject them if you wish.</p>
<p>Mere failure to stop does not constitute flight. To find flight, you must   find that the defendants purpose in leaving was to avoid being stopped by the   officer. A person attempts to perform an act if (he/she) does or omits to do   anything with the purpose of performing that act without further conduct on   (his/her) part, or purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the   circumstances as a reasonable person would believe them to be, is an act or   omission constituting a substantial step planned to culminate in the performance   of that act. A person acts purposely with respect to the nature of (his/her)   conduct or a result thereof if it is (his/her) conscious object to engage in   conduct of that nature or to cause such a result. A person acts knowingly with   respect to the attendant circumstances of his/her conduct if he/she is aware   that such circumstances exist, or is aware of a high probability of their   existence. &quot;Knowing&quot; or &quot;with knowledge&quot; or equivalent terms have the same   meaning. If you find that the State has failed to prove any one of these   elements beyond a reasonable doubt you must find the defendant not guilty.   [CHARGE FOLLOWING SENTENCE IF SUBMITTING ONLY THIRD DEGREE] On the other hand,   if you find that the State has proven all of these elements beyond a reasonable   doubt, you must find the defendant guilty. [CHARGE REMAINING PARAGRAPHS IF   SUBMITTING SECOND DEGREE] If you find that the State has proven all six of the   above elements beyond a reasonable doubt, you must go on in your deliberations   to consider a seventh element, which will distinguish third-degree eluding from   the greater offense of second-degree eluding. The State must prove beyond a   reasonable doubt: 7. That the flight or attempt to elude created a risk of death   or injury to any person. &quot;Injury&quot; means physical pain, illness, or any   impairment of physical condition.1 In order to find this element, you must   determine that there was at least one person put at risk by the defendants   conduct, including persons along the chase route, police officers in the chasing   vehicle, or persons in the eluding vehicle.2</p>
<p>[CHARGE IF APPLICABLE:]3</p>
<p>You may infer risk of death or injury to any person if the defendants conduct   in fleeing or in attempting to elude the officer involved a violation of the   motor vehicle law of this State [OR: the law regulating power vessels]. It is   alleged that defendants conduct involved [a] violation[s] of the motor vehicle   law [OR: the law regulating power vessels]. Specifically, it is alleged that   defendant [list motor vehicle violations or power vessel violations alleged, and   list their elements, taking care to list only those violations that allegedly   occurred after the signal to stop]. Whether (he/she) is guilty or not guilty of   that [those] offense[s] will be determined by an appropriate court.4In other   words, it is not your job to decide whether (he/she) is guilty or not guilty of   the motor vehicle [OR: power vessel] offense[s]. However, you may consider the   evidence that (he/she) committed [a] motor vehicle offense[s] [OR: power vessel   offense[s] ] in deciding whether (he/she) created a risk of death or injury. At   the same time, remember that you are never required or compelled to draw this   inference. As I have already explained, it is your exclusive province to   determine whether the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence support any   inference and you are always free to accept or reject any inference if you wish.   If you find that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt all seven   elements of the offense, then you must find the defendant guilty of the second   degree crime of eluding an officer. On the other hand, if you find that the   State has failed to prove the seventh element beyond a reasonable doubt, but has   proven the first six elements beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the   defendant not guilty of second degree eluding and guilty of third degree   eluding. Finally, if you find that the State has failed to prove any of the   first six elements beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant   not guilty of either crime.</p>
<p>1 State v. Wallace, 158 N.J. 552, 558 (1999), holds that the term &quot;injury&quot;   should be defined for the jury, using the Code definition of &quot;bodily injury,&quot;   N.J.S.A. 2C:11-1a. Property damage, psychological injury, or other nonphysical   injury do not satisfy the statutory requirement. Id.</p>
<p>2 Wallace, 158 N.J. at 560.</p>
<p>3 Only violations of Chapter 4 of Title 39 (motor vehicles) or Chapter 7 of   Title 12 (power vessels) will support this statutory inference. However, not all   such violations will support the inference, and it should not be submitted where   no reasonable juror on the evidence as a whole, including the evidence of the   motor vehicle or power vessel violation, could find a risk of death or injury to   any person beyond a reasonable doubt. N.J.R.E. 303b; State v. DiRienzo, 53 N.J.   360, 378 (1969).</p>
<p>4 Because it is inappropriate to submit to a jury a lesser motor-vehicle   offense related to an indictable prosecution properly before them, State v.   Muniz, 118 N.J. 319, 331-32 (1990), the jury should be instructed, if   appropriate, that any outstanding motor vehicle charge will be determined by an   appropriate court. At the same time, the failure to explain, in appropriate   circumstances, the elements of the motor vehicle offenses that form the basis   for the statutory inference of recklessness, so that the jury can make an   accurate determination whether the defendants conduct &quot;created the danger of   death or injury,&quot; is reversible error. State v. Dorko, 298 N.J. Super. at 59-60.   Accordingly, the court should explain the elements of the applicable motor   vehicle offenses to the jury, but inform them that the defendants guilt or   innocence of those offenses will be determined by an appropriate court. The jury   should be instructed not to speculate as to whether any such charges have been   filed or disposed of. The same principles would appear to apply if a power   vessel offense, rather than a motor vehicle offense, is alleged as the basis for   the statutory inference.</p>
