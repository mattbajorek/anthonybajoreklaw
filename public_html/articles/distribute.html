<h1 align="center"><strong>Possession of Drugs with Intent to Distribute   Drugs</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC represents individuals charged with criminal and serious traffic violations   throughout New Jersey.</p>
<p>If someone is Indicted for Possession of Drugs with Intent to Distribute, the   Judge will read portions of the following to the Jury. They are called request   to charge. Count of the indictment charges the defendant as follows: (Read   Indictment)</p>
<p>The pertinent part of the statute (N.J.S.A. 2C:35-5)1 on which this   indictment is based reads as follows:</p>
<p>Except as authorized by (statute), it shall be unlawful for any person   knowingly or purposely ... to possess or have under his control with intent to   ... distribute a controlled dangerous substance (or controlled substance   analog).</p>
<p>2 The various kinds of substances are defined in another part of our statute.   (Insert appropriate CDS, e.g., heroin, cocaine, etc.) is a dangerous substance   prohibited by statute. (The defendant does not claim legal authorization, so the   exceptions in the statute are not applicable in this case.) The statute, read   together with the indictment, identifies the elements which the State must prove   beyond a reasonable doubt to establish guilt of the defendant on this (count of   the) indictment.</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The substance in evidence is (insert appropriate CDS or controlled   substance analog).</p>
<p>2. The defendant possessed, or had under (his/her) control, S in   evidence.</p>
<p>3. The defendant, when (he/she) possessed or had under (his/her) control S in   evidence, had the intent to distribute S in evidence.</p>
<p>4. That the defendant acted knowingly or purposefully in possessing or having   under (his/her) control with intent to distribute S in evidence.</p>
<p>[when it is alleged that a controlled substance analog was possessed with   intent to distribute the following definition of controlled substance analog   should be charged]:</p>
<p>In regard to the first element, a controlled substance analog is a substance   which (1) has a chemical structure substantially similar to that of a controlled   dangerous substance and (2) was specifically designed to produce an effect   substantially similar to that of a controlled substance.3 In this case the   indictment alleges that the defendant distributed which is an analog of the   controlled dangerous substance . Thus, to establish this element the State must   prove beyond a reasonable doubt that has a substantially similar chemical   structure to the controlled dangerous substance and that was specifically   designed to produce an effect substantially similar to the controlled dangerous   substance.</p>
<p>In regard to the second element, that the defendant had under (his/her)   control or possessed S in evidence, possess means (charge definition of   possession). In regard to the third element, that the defendant had the intent   to distribute S in evidence, distribute means the transfer, actual, constructive   or attempted,4 from one person to another of a controlled dangerous substance   (or controlled substance analog). It is not necessary that the drugs be   transferred in exchange for payment or promise of payment of money or anything   of value.</p>
<p>5 Intent means a purpose to do something, a resolution to do a particular act   or accomplish a certain thing. Intent is a state of mind, and it is very rare   that intent is proven by witnesses who can testify that an accused said (he/she)   had a certain intent when (he/she) engaged in a particular act. The intention   may be gathered from a persons acts, conduct, from all the person said and did   at the particular time and place, and from all of the surrounding circumstances.   You may consider any evidence as to the quantity, purity, and packaging</p>
<p>6 of S together with all the other evidence in the case to aid you in your   determination of the element of intent to distribute. In regard to the fourth   element, the State must prove, as I have stated, that the defendant acted   knowingly or purposefully in having under (his/her) control or possessing S with   intent to distribute. A person acts knowingly with respect to the nature of   (his/her) conduct or the attendant circumstances if (he/she) is aware that   (his/her) conduct is of that nature, or that such circumstances exist, or   (he/she) is aware of a high probability of their existence. A person acts   knowingly with respect to a result of (his/her) conduct if he is aware that it   is practically certain that (his/her) conduct will cause such a result. Knowing,   with knowledge or equivalent terms have the same meaning.</p>
<p>7A person acts purposely with respect to the nature of (his/her) conduct or a   result thereof if it is (his/her) conscious object to engage in conduct of that   nature or to cause such a result. A person acts purposely with respect to   attendant circumstances if (he/she) is aware of the existence of such   circumstances of (he/she) believes or hopes that they exist. With purpose,   designed, with design or equivalent terms have the same meaning.8 The terms   knowingly and purposefully, like intent, refer to conditions of the mind that   cannot be seen. It is not necessary for the State to prove the existence of such   mental states by direct evidence such as a statement by the defendant that   (he/she) had particular knowledge or a particular purpose. Knowledge and purpose   as separate propositions of proof do not commonly exist. They must ordinarily be   discovered as other mental states are from circumstantial evidence; that is, by   reference to the defendants conduct, words or acts and all the surrounding   circumstances.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the four elements of this offense are that:</p>
<p>1. The substance in evidence is (insert appropriate CDS or controlled   substance analog).</p>
<p>2. The defendant possessed, or had under (his/her) control, S in   evidence.</p>
<p>3. The defendant had the intent to distribute S in evidence.</p>
<p>4. That the defendant acted knowingly or purposely in possessing or having   under (his/her) control with intent to distribute S in evidence.</p>
<p>If you find that the State had proven all these elements beyond a reasonable   doubt, then you must return a verdict of guilty. On the other hand, if you find   that the State has failed to prove any of these elements beyond a reasonable   doubt, then you must return a verdict of not guilty.</p>

<p>----- 1 N.J.S.A. 2C:35-5 grades this offense for sentencing purposes by the   type, quantity and purity of the CDS involved. In certain cases, the defendant   is guilty of an offense regardless of the quantity and purity of the CDS   distributed. This charge is sufficient for such cases. However, in cases in   which the quantity and/or purity of the CDS is an element of the offense,   N.J.S.A. 2C:35-5c requires that this element be determined by the jury. In such   a case, this charge would have to be supplemented to add this element. Please   see the supplementary model charge concerning this.</p>
