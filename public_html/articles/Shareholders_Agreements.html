<h1 align="center"><strong>Shareholders Agreements - Sample Transfer   Clause</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>Usually it is in the best interest of a small Corporation and of Shareholders   to make provisions for the future disposition of the shares of Corporation, and   to provide that such shares shall be transferable only upon compliance with   decided terms.</p>
<p>Shareholders often desire to set forth their respective rights concerning   Corporations stock with regard to death, disability, retirement and other future   disposition of the stock by any Shareholder by imposing certain restrictions and   obligations on themselves, on Corporation and on their shares of stock of   Corporation.</p>
<p>Therefore, Shareholders and Corporation can sign a shareholders agreement   which incorporates some of the following provisions: TRANSFERABILITY OF SHARES   DURING LIFETIME:</p>
<p>In the event that this section is applicable to any Shareholder, said   Shareholder hereby grants to the Corporation and other Shareholders, an option   to purchase of stock of Corporation now owned or held, or hereafter acquired, by   such Shareholder, such option to be exercisable upon the occurrence of any of   the following events:</p>
<p>1. Any attempt by any Shareholder to sell, assign, transfer or in any way   dispose of any or all shares of stock, or the beneficial interest therein; or 2.   Any pledge or the creation of any encumbrance on any or all of the shares of   stock; or 3. Any other transfer of any or all of the shares of stock, or the   beneficial interest therein, of Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary,   by operation of law or otherwise, including but not limited to, all executions   or legal processes attaching such shares of stock and all processes affecting   the interest of any Shareholder with respect to his shares of stock of   Corporation; or 4. The judicial declaration that any Shareholder is incompetent   or the adjudication that any Shareholder is bankrupt, or the appointment for any   Shareholder of a trustee or receiver or any assignment by a Shareholder for the   benefit of creditors for the shares of stock of Corporation; or 5. Termination   of employment of any Shareholder by Corporation for cause, other than disability   for a period not exceeding twelve (12) consecutive months, death or retirement   (the term &quot;cause&quot; including the conviction of any Shareholder of a Felony or   High Misdemeanor in any Court of competent jurisdiction as well as the   conviction of any Shareholder of any crime or disorderly persons offense   involving larceny, embezzlement or other unlawful taking of Corporations   assets).</p>
<p>Within five days of the occurrence of any of the events set forth above, the   Shareholder whose shares of stock are so affected shall send notice in writing   to Corporation and to the remaining Shareholders of such fact. During the period   with the occurrence of such event, and (a) if notice is given, shall end thirty   (30) days after such notice is given, or (b) if no notice is given, shall   continue without end, Corporation shall have the right to exercise its option to   purchase the shares of stock on the terms and conditions set forth herein.</p>
<p>Any shares of stock not accepted for purchase by Corporation shall be deemed   to be offered to the remaining Shareholders who shall have the right,   exercisable within an additional period of fifteen (15) days, to exercise their   option to purchase the said shares of stock upon the terms and conditions set   forth herein.</p>
<p>Upon acceptance of the option, the remaining Shareholders shall each purchase   a proportionate share of the stock of the offeror. &quot;Proportionate Share&quot; shall   mean that portion of the shares of Corporation offered for sale which the shares   of the Corporation owned by a Shareholder bear to the shares of the Corporation   (other than those offered for sale) owned by all the Shareholders.</p>
<p>In the event that any remaining Shareholder does not exercise his option to   purchase his proportionate share, his proportionate share shall be subject to an   option to purchase same by the Shareholders exercising their option as set forth   hereinabove.</p>
<p>Corporation shall have and is hereby given the right to refuse to record any   transfer of any of the shares of stock covered by this agreement, unless said   transfer is made in accordance with the terms hereof.</p>
<p>No Shareholder may be required to sell less than all of the shares of stock   of Corporation owned or held by him. If any event occurs pursuant to which   Corporation and the remaining Shareholders may exercise their option to   purchase, the Corporation and the other Shareholders fail to so exercise their   option to purchase all of the shares of stock offered for sale, within the   allotted time, said option to purchase shall terminate; provided, however, that   if the shares of stock are not sold pursuant to the notice within six (6) months   after the notice is given, the stock may not be sold unless reoffered pursuant   to this agreement.</p>
