The best   interest of a child requires that a parent affirmatively assume the duties   encompassed by the role of being a parent. In determining whether a parent has   affirmatively assumed the duties of a parent, the court shall consider, but is   not limited to consideration of, the fulfillment of financial obligations for   the birth and care of the child, demonstration of continued interest in the   child, demonstration of a genuine effort to maintain communication with the   child, and demonstration of the establishment and maintenance of a place of   importance in the childs life.</p>

<p>(1)that the parent has substantially failed to perform the regular and   expected parental functions of care and support of the child, although able to   do so, or</p>
<p>(2)that the parent is unable to perform the regular and expected parental   functions of care and support of the child and that the parents inability to   perform those functions is unlikely to change in the immediate future.</p>
<p>The regular and expected functions of care and support of a child shall   include the following:</p>
<p>(a)the maintenance of a relationship with the child such that the child   perceives the person as his parent;</p>
<p>(b)communicating with the child or person having legal custody of the child   and parenting time rights, or unless prevented from so doing by the custodial   parent or other custodian of the child or a social service agency over the birth   parents objection; or</p>
<p>(c)providing financial support for the child unless prevented from doing so   by the custodial parent or other custodian of the child or a social service   agency.</p>
<p>A parent shall be presumed to have failed to perform the regular and expected   parental functions of care and support of the child if the court finds that the   situation set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) has occurred during the six-month   period prior to the placement of the child for adoption, or within 120 days   after the birth of a child or prior to the date of the preliminary hearing,   whichever occurs first, in the case of a child placed for adoption as a newborn   infant.</p>
<p>In the case where the objecting parent is incarcerated during the six-month   period prior to placement of the child for adoption, relevant factors to be   considered in determining whether that incarcerated parent has failed to perform   the regular and expected parental functions or is unable to perform the regular   and expected parental functions pursuant to this subsection, shall include the   extent of the relationship which existed between the parent and child prior to   incarceration, including financial support; the efforts made to continue a   relationship during the incarceration; the ability to communicate and visit with   the child during incarceration; and the effect of the communication and   visitation on the childs development in terms of providing nurturing and   emotional support.</p>
<p>b.The guardian of a child to be adopted who has not executed a surrender   pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1977, c.367 (C.9:3-41) and any other person who has   provided primary care and supervision in his home for the child for a period of   six months or one half of the life of the child, whichever is less, in the two   years prior to the complaint shall be given notice of the action and in   accordance with the Rules of Court shall have standing to object to the   adoption, which objection shall be given due consideration by the court in   determining whether the best interests of the child would be promoted by the   adoption.</p>
