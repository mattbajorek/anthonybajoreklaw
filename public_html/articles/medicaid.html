<p>WHAT IS MEDICAID?..........</p>
<p>Medicaid is a Federal medical bills assistance program that pays medical   bills for eligible, needy persons. It is administered by each state. All   payments are made directly to the providers of medical and other health care   services. The Medicaid-eligible person does not pay the health care provider for   services. The only exception is a patient in a Medicaid-approved nursing   facility who may be required to contribute part of his/her income toward the   cost of care.</p>
<p>Medicaid Planning After Reform</p>
<p>By Thomas D. Begley, Jr.</p>
<p>Congress has passed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 which seriously   curtails Medicaid Asset Transfers and makes it much more difficult for people to   become eligible for Medicaid. The Bill was backed by the Insurance Industry and   the Pharmaceutical Industry with AARP opposing the bill on the side of   consumers. The vote was 216 to 214 in the House of Representatives and Dick   Cheney had to break a tie in the Senate.</p>
<p>1. NEW LAW. The new law is known as the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005</p>
<p>1.1. 6011 - Lengthening Lookback Period; Change in Beginning Date for Period   of Ineligibility.</p>
<p>1.1.1. Lookback. The lookback period is extended to 5 years.</p>
<p>1.1.2. Beginning Date. The beginning date of the period of ineligibility has   changed from the date the transfer was made to the later of the date of the   transfer was made or the date the individual:</p>
<p>would be eligible for medical assistance; and</p>
<p>would otherwise be receiving institutional level care based on an approved   application for such care, but for the application of the penalty period,   whichever is later; and</p>
<p>which does not occur during any other period of ineligibility.</p>
<p>1.1.3. Commentary. The effect of these provisions will be to make it much   more difficult to transfer assets and to obtain Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<p>2. 6012 Disclosure &amp; Treatment of Annuities.</p>
<p>2.1. Disclosure of Annuities.</p>
<p>2.1.1. Disclosure. At the time of a Medicaid application or re-certification   of eligibility the applicant must disclose a description of any interest the   individual or community spouse has in an annuity. The state may require the   issuer to notify the state when there is a change in the amount of income or   principal being withdrawn.</p>
<p>2.2. Treatment of Annuities.</p>
<p>2.2.1. State Named as Beneficiary. Transfer of an annuity shall be treated as   a transfers of assets for less than fair market value unless:</p>
<p>Remainder Beneficiary. The state is named as remainder beneficiary in the   first position for at least the total amount of medical assistance paid on   behalf of the annuitant; or</p>
<p>Second Position. The state is named as a beneficiary in the second position   after the community spouse or minor or disabled child and is named in first   position if such spouse or a representative of such child disposes of any   remainder for less than fair market value.</p>
<p>2.2.1.1. Design of Annuity. Annuities are not subject to the transfer of   assets provisions if:</p>
<p>it is owned by IRA or purchased with the proceeds from an IRA, an SEP, or a   Roth IRA; or</p>
<p>the annuity is:</p>
<p>_ irrevocable</p>
<p>_ non-assignable</p>
<p>_ actuarially sound as determined in accordance with the actuarial   publications of the Office of Chief Actuary of the Social Security   Administration; and</p>
<p>provides for payments in equal amounts during the term of the annuity with no   deferral and no balloon payment.</p>
<p>Commentary. This means only that the purchase of an annuity is not subject to   the transfer of asset penalties. The issue as to whether the annuity is a   countable asset is not addressed.</p>
<p>3. 6013 Income First. States must follow the income first rule when   calculating an expansion of the Community Spouse Resource Allowance.</p>
<p>Commentary. New Jersey has always followed the Income First Rule.</p>
<p>4. 6014 Home Equity.</p>
<p>4.1. Limits. A person is ineligible for Medicaid if he has equity in the home   in excess of $500,000 or at state option $750,000. This number is indexed for   inflation.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION: The maximum amount does not apply if the home is occupied by:</p>
<p>spouse<br />
  child under age 21</p>
<p>child who is blind or permanently and totally disabled</p>
<p>4.1.2. Loan. The applicant is encouraged by the Act to obtain a reverse   mortgage or home equity loan to reduce equity.</p>
<p>Commentary: This restriction is not as severe as it may first appear and may   actually present some planning opportunities</p>
<p>5. 6015 CCRC Contracts. This section clarifies the treatment of CCRC   Contracts and entrance fees.</p>
<p>5.1. Transfer Provisions. Provisions in CCRC contracts restricting transfers   of assets are enforceable.</p>
<p>Commentary: Many lawyers simply ignored provisions in CCRC contracts   restricting transfers. These are now clearly enforceable under the new law.</p>
<p>6. 6016 Additional Reforms of Medicaid Asset Transfer Rules.</p>
<p>6.1. Partial Month Penalties. Partial month penalties are mandated.</p>
<p>6.2. Accumulation of Multiple Transfers.</p>
<p>Fractional transfers of assets in more than one month are accumulated.</p>
<p>Transfers during all months are treated as one transfer.</p>
<p>Commentary: This makes small gifts impossible in many situations.</p>
<p>6.3. Notes and Other Loan Assets. For transfer of assets purposes promissory   notes, loans and mortgages are included unless:</p>
<p>they include an actuarially-sound repayment term as calculated by the Office   of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration; and</p>
<p>payments are made in equal amounts with no deferral or balloon payment;   and</p>
<p>the document prohibits the cancellation of the balance upon the death of the   lender. 6.4. Purchase of Life Estates. The purchase of a life estate is not   considered to be a transfer of assets if the purchaser resides in the home for a   period of at least one year.</p>
<p>Commentary: There may be situations where this portion of the statute   presents additional planning opportunities. There are some serious risks   involving the due on sale clause in mortgages and capital gains tax   considerations for the parent and child that need to be considered, but in the   right situation this will present a planning opportunity.</p>
<p>7. PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES ELIMINATED. Opportunities that have been eliminated   include the following:</p>
<p>Transfer Assets/Wait Three Years</p>
<p>Half-a-Loaf Transfer</p>
<p>Monthly Transfers</p>
<p>Lookback Period</p>
<p>Transfers from Retirement Plans within a Lookback Period</p>
<p>SCIN - By definition a SCIN is a loan that cancels on the death of the   lender.</p>
<p>8. CONCLUSION. There are a number of planning opportunities that remain under   the new law, but many of them will not have been tested. Clients may be required   to apply for Medicaid, be rejected, apply for a Fair Hearing and in some   instances appeal to the New Jersey Appellate Division and possibly even the New   Jersey Supreme Court before these strategies are validated. Medicaid Planning is   no longer for the faint of heart. Elder Law will become much more of a   litigation practice than a transactional practice. Clients should consult an   experienced Elder Law attorney who is not easily intimidated.</p>

<p>Resource and Income Limitations for<br />
  Spouses of Medicaid Applicants</p>
<p>by Dana E. Bookbinder, Esquire</p>
<p>Now that the President has signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, it is   even more crucial for families to be proactive in protecting their loved ones   health care options and financial savings. Often individuals are lulled into   thinking that the government will not aggressively pursue their assets if they   dont engage in legal planning, but the opposite is in fact true. In cases of   married couples, the healthier spouse often mistakenly believes that his or her   assets are safe while only the ill spouses assets have to be paid to a nursing   facility for that spouses care. Again, this is incorrect, and early legal   planning can save the family much grief in addition to substantial assets. While   both married and single individuals can substantially benefit from early legal   planning, under Congress new budget saving scheme, married couples, in   particular, would be passing up the opportunity to protect their savings if they   failed to seek legal counsel since the asset and income limitations they would   face for Medicaid eligibility are low.</p>
<p>The resource allowance permitted to be retained by the spouse of a benefits   recipient is known as the Community Spouse Resource Allowance (CSRA). This   allowance was established by the Medicaid Coverage Catastrophic Act (MCCA),   enacted to apply to individuals institutionalized on or after September 30,1989   to protect spouses against impoverishment.</p>
<p>The amount of the community spouse resource allowance is generally based on   one half (1/2) of the couples combined total countable resources as of the first   period of continuous institutionalization. A resource assessment of the couples   countable assets as of the first period of continuous institutionalization of   one of the spouses will be undertaken when a Medicaid application is filed. By   law, it must also be done upon the request of the Medicaid applicant, the   applicants spouse, or the personal representative of the applicant or the   spouse. A continuous period of institutionalization is broken by absences from   the institution for thirty consecutive days. For 2006, the CSRA is subject to a   maximum of $99,540 and a minimum of $19,908. These numbers are adjusted on an   annual basis.</p>
<p>In addition to a resource allowance, the spouse of a Medicaid recipient is   entitled to a monthly income allowance. Generally, the income of an individual   who is institutionalized must be forwarded to his nursing home on a monthly   basis. However, this spouse is allowed to retain her own income plus, depending   on the amount of her income, a monthly allowance to be taken from the   institutionalized spouses income. This allowance is called the Minimum Monthly   Maintenance Needs Allowance (MMMNA). Currently, the amount is based upon the   difference between $1,604 and the community spouses income plus an additional   amount to cover shelter expenses for the community spouse. The shelter expenses   are based upon the actual mortgage and real estate taxes that must be paid plus   certain allowances for utilities. These figures upon which the MMMNA calculation   are based are adjusted annually.</p>
<p>Failure to plan ahead for the long-term care costs of a spouse can severely   impact the healthy spouses financial status. However, elder law attorneys can   increase both the spouses resource and income allowances through agency   hearings. Additionally without a hearing, elder law attorneys can help their   clients maintain their standards of living, enabling them to continue living   independently in their homes.</p>

  See   Medicaid, what is it by NJ Department of Human Services, Division of Medical   Assistance.</p>
<p>Your Responsibilities when applying for Medicaid</p>
<p>You must give complete and factual information on the application.<br />
  You   must provide or apply for a Social Security Number.<br />
  You must promptly notify   the county welfare agency whenever there is a change in your existing income, or   an additional income or resource, such as:</p>
<p>* income from a new job or loss of an old one<br />
  * change in wages from full   or part-time job<br />
  * Workers Compensation<br />
  * unemployment or temporary   disability benefits<br />
  * Social Security or Veterans benefits<br />
  * pension or   other retirement benefits<br />
  * Supplemental Security Income (SSI)<br />
  * interest   on savings<br />
  * accident claims or settlements<br />
  * support payments<br />
  * an   inheritance of money or property<br />
  * money from the sale of property<br />
  * funds   received in settlement of s claim or legal suit<br />
  * lottery winnings or other   awards<br />
  * any other change in income or resources<br />
  * court action related to   any of the above<br />
  See Medicaid, what is it by NJ Department of Human Services,   Division of Medical Assistance.</p>
<p><br />
  If you are residing in a nursing facility, you must also report:</p>
<p>* when you obtain or drop health insurance coverage<br />
  * changes in health   insurance premiums<br />
  * changes in spousal income, if you are paying spousal   maintenance</p>
<p>The Law requires that all health and accident insurance benefits, including   Medicare, Workers Compensation and No Fault Auto Insurance must be used before   Medicaid in the payment of health care.</p>
<p><br />
  You must agree to assign to the Commissioner any rights to payment from   any third party.</p>
<p><br />
  When applying to the county welfare agency for special institutional   services including nursing home care, you must make an accurate report of your   actual income. Normally, that income ( except for a personal needs allowance and   certain disregards, if applicable) must be applied to the cost of your care.</p>
<p>You must authorize the county welfare agency to contact any source that may   have knowledge about your circumstances ( including IRS, Social Security wage   and benefits files, and state wage and employment files), for the sole purpose   of verifying the statements that you make on the application. See Your Rights   and Responsibilities when applying for Medicaid by NJ. Department of Human   Services, Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services.</p>
<p>If you or a spouse have to enter a nursing home to receive custodial type   care, your assets (other than your residence and various personal items which   may be exempt under certain circumstances) are worth less than $2,000, and the   income of the person entering the home (including Social Security) is no more   than $1,410 per month for 1996, then you may be eligible for this government   program which can pay for substantially all of the cost of the nursing home.   Moreover, it is possible for a married spouse who remains at home to preserve a   significant portion of the assets of the couple if the other spouse is   institutionalized. In 1996, the law permits a minimum of $15, 348 of such assets   to be protected. And, depending upon the amount of such assets, a maximum of   one-half (but not exceeding $76,740) may be preserved. In addition, in the case   of married persons, it may be possible to have some of the income of the spouse   in the nursing home paid to the at home spouse without affecting eligibility for   Medicaid Only.</p>
<p>When considering an application for Medicaid, one should bear in mind that   the rules are fairly complicated, and that transfers of assets to third parties   (such as gifts to children) in order to become eligible for the program can   result in a penalty period being imposed during which payments by the State will   not be made for nursing home care.</p>
<p>____ The penalty is a period of ineligibility for Medicaid, determined by   dividing the value of the assets transferred by the average cost of a nursing   home in New Jersey. States must apportion the period of ineligibility between   spouses so that only one penalty applies. In the case of joint assets, a   withdrawal by one party is considered a transfer. The new law subjects transfers   of income to a period of ineligibility. Transfer penalties can be avoided by   returning all of the assets which were transferred. The law made significant   changes in the area of trusts. However, certain types of trusts are still   permitted. The Secretary of Health and Human Services was directed to promulgate   regulations concerning annuities. As of this writing, those regulations have not   yet been promulgated. States are now mandated to recover payments from the   estates of Medicaid recipients.</p>
<p>Hearings</p>
<p>If your application for Medicaid benefits is denied, if your Medicaid   eligibility is terminated, or if Medicaid refuses to pay a claim, you have a   right to a fair hearing before a New Jersey Administrative Law Judge. At that   hearing you have a right to be represented by counsel and to present evidence   including testimony to support your case. The judge makes a recommendation to   Medicaid regarding your case. Then, if Medicaid still denies your claim, you   have a right to appeal to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New   Jersey. In a situation where Medicaid has advised you that it intends to   discontinue the payment of benefits, you may have a right to have benefits   continued until your appeal has been decided.<br />
  At the time of this printing,   the Federal and State Governments are considering substantial changes in both   Medicare and Medicaid. See New Jersey State Bar Foundation, Law Points for   Senior Citizens.<br />
