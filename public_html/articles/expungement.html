<h1 align="center"><strong>2C:52-1 Expungement/Erase Criminal Arrests</strong></h1>
<p align="center">
<p>The Law Office of Anthony G. Bajorek, LLC represents individuals charged with criminal and serious traffic violations   throughout New Jersey.</p>
<p>Thousands of citizens in New Jersey over the past 20 years have been arrested   for criminal, disorderly, and municipal ordinance offenses. They may include   your neighbors, friends and loyal church goers. The police keep a record of all   arrests and convictions, even if 20 years old. These secrets of the past will   soon be open to anyone in New Jersey including credit agencies. Under a proposal   by the New Jersey Attorney General, for a $15.00 fee, anybody could ask the   state police for a persons criminal record, even arrests with not guilty   findings. Allowing access to a persons old criminal conviction or arrest record   could open the door for discrimination against someone who now is a productive,   respected, and law abiding citizen.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if you are a law abiding citizen, you can now have old arrests   or convictions erased from public records and police folders. Under NJSA 2C:52-1   et seq. past criminal convictions can be expunged erased under certain   instances. For example, if you were convicted or pleaded guilty to a disorderly   person offense (misdemeanor type) more than 5 years ago, and have not been   convicted of anything since, you can have your attorney petition to the Superior   Court for an Expungement (Erase and removal) of your criminal record. If you   plead guilty to a town ordinance (ex. - Seaside Heights Drinking in Public) you   can petition for an Expungement after waiting two years. A Juvenile   delinquent/guilty finding for a minor can also be expunged/erased under similar   circumstances. In addition, minor drug arrests which resulted in first offender   conditional discharge can be erased if one year has passed since termination of   probation or conclusion of court proceedings.</p>
<p>Most importantly, arrests on frivolous complaints which did not result in a   conviction or if charges were dismissed, can be expunged, without waiting. THE   EXPUNGEMENT PETITION</p>
<p>You should contact an attorney experienced with handling expungements in the   Superior Court. Your attorney will prepare an expungement petition which under   state law must contain substantial background information, including:</p>
<p>a. Date of Birth and Social Security #</p>
<p>b. Date of Arrest</p>
<p>c. Statute Arrested For and Statute Convicted</p>
<p>d. Original Indictment, Summons, or Complaint Number</p>
<p>e. Petitioners Date of Conviction or Date of Disposition</p>
<p>f. Courts Disposition of the Matter and Punishment Adopted, if Any</p>
<p>In addition, the Expungement Petition must have an affidavit that states that   there are no charges pending and that the petitioner never previously received a   prior expungement. The Expungement Petition is filed in the county where the   offense took place, not where the defendant lives. Once filed, the Superior   Court will set a hearing within 35-60 days.</p>
<p>As required under the statute, the attorney for the applicant must serve a   copy of the Petition Order for hearing and supporting documents on the following   people:</p>
<p>1. Superintendent of State Police 2. Attorney General 3. County Prosecutor of   the county where the court is located 4. The Chief of Police where the event   took place 5. The chief law enforcement officer of any law enforcement agency   which participated in the arrest 6. The warden of any institution where the   petitioner was confined, and 7. If the disposition was made by a municipal   court, upon the municipal court which heard the case.</p>
<p>If you satisfy all other statutory requirements and there is no objection by   the entities notified, the court will usually grant an order directing the clerk   of the court and all relevant criminal justice and law enforcement agencies to   expunge (remove) records of said disposition including evidence of arrest,   detention, conviction, and proceedings.</p>
<p>There are additional pleadings which the applicants attorney must prepare and   file. If you have an old offense, it is important that you have the arrest   expunged to keep your name and record clean.</p>
